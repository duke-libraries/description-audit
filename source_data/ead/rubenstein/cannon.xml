      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>Processed by David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library Staff</p>
      <p>Encoded by Gabriela A. Montoya</p>
      <p>Processing Note: The pre-processing arrangement of these surviving records was also random.
        The company had stored parts of their earlier records in various places, and either the
        major part of its archives had never been stored or else had been discarded. Thus,
        retention, storage, and retrieval for this collection were all random. The result was a
        jigsaw puzzle that had to be both designed and assembled during processing.</p>
      <p>The provenance of the files was greatly disturbed, and the structure and location of many
        files in the company's offices is unclear. Effort has been made to assign files to series
        appropriate to the office or constituent company to which they belonged, but, in many cases,
        filing represents a processing decision rather than known provenance.</p>
      <p>The executive office files are a particular case of mixed provenance. The five series for
        1950, 1952, 1970, 1971, and 1979 remain in their original arrangement, but where they were
        kept in the company's main office is not clear. Correspondence of major executives is in
        these files, but letters for the same individuals are also in other series. The Executive
        Office Files Series, 1923-1980, is largely a repository of records for which reconstitution
        of provenance required undue time and effort. The term "Executive Office Files" was adopted
        in order to indicate that these files usually represent the higher levels of the managerial
        structure.</p>
      <p>Each series contains one or the other or both of two form divisions: Boxed Files and
        Volumes; and Volumes Shelved in Numerical Sequence. The Boxed Files and Volumes are mostly
        files, but some volumes are included, usually for better preservation. The Volumes Shelved
        in Numerical Sequence are mostly account books, many of them too large for housing in
        boxes.</p>
      <p>Printed publications removed from the collection are partial files of "Cotton's Week,"
        "Kiplinger Agricultural Letter," "Kiplinger Tax Letter," "Kiplinger Washington Letter,"
        Whaley- Eaton Services "American Letter" and "Foreign Letter," "Textile Hi-Lights," "Textile
        Trends," Babson's "Weekly Staff Letter," "Gallagher President's Report," "The Corporate
        Shareholder," and the "Seidman News Bulletin."</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Cannon Mills Records, a textile manufacturer, span the years 1836-1983, although the
        bulk occurs during 1887-1983. Files and account books concern the operations of Cannon
        Manufacturing Company and its successor in 1928, Cannon Mills, its subsidiary and associated
        textile mills, related business interests, and community involvement. The records include
        correspondence, volumes, memoranda, statistical compilations, reports, printed material, and
        financial and legal documents.</p>
      <p>In 1898 Cannon Manufacturing Company switched to towel manufacturing, and in later years
        the product line expanded into blankets. In 1971 sales exceeded $305 million, and the
        company dominated over 50% of the country's towel business and over 20% of the sheet
        business.</p>
      <p>Important topics include the textile industry, economic conditions related to the textile
        industry, textile marketing and sales, state and national textile industry associations and
        public and governmental relations; textile industry consolidation; textile equipment and
        manufacturers; textile production and costs; an antebellum textile mill; and the Cannon,
        Patterson, Swink, Odell, Barringer, Johnston, Murdoch, and other families who were owners
        and managers of one or more of the textile mills.</p>
      <p>Topics and materials related to personnel are millworkers (both men and women), child labor
        (both girls and boys), employee retirement plans, the Textile Workers Union of America, time
        books, employee injuries, company mercantile stores, and mill houses and villages.</p>
      <p>Other business activities involved building construction, architects, and contractors;
        investment in securities and commodities; advertising; taxation; stock and stockholders
        (both men and women); corporate directors; insurance; bankruptcy and bad debts; cotton
        brokers; cotton buying and the cotton market; dividends; banks and banking; mill
        superintendents' records; real estate; lawsuits, one involving racial discrimination; and
        estate settlements.</p>
      <p>Community relations are evident in records relating to churches, schools, the Y.M.C.A.,
        Freemasons, philanthropy to local organizations, and secondary boarding schools in North
        Carolina and the inception of agricultural training for boys and home economics for girls.
        The city of Kannapolis, N.C., in which the main offices of Cannon were located, was a
        particular focus of company interest.</p>
      <p>There are record series for the nine companies that were consolidated in 1928 to form
        Cannon Mills: Cannon Manufacturing Company, Cabarrus Cotton Mills, Barringer Manufacturing
        Company, Franklin Cotton Mills, Gibson Manufacturing Company, Kesler Manufacturing Company,
        Patterson Manufacturing Company, Norcott Mills Company, and Hobarton Manufacturing Company.
        These mills were all in the western Piedmont of North Carolina.</p>
      <p>A number of other mills, owned by or associated with the Cannons or Cannon Mills, had a
        separate existence in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama. Those mills,
        represented in this collection by series, include Central Mills, Central, S.C.; Bloomfield
        Manufacturing Co., Statesville, N.C.; Brown Manufacturing Co., Concord, N.C.; Roberta
        Manufacturing Co., Cabarrus County, N.C.; Imperial Cotton Mills, Eatonton, Georgia; Social
        Circle Cotton Mills, Walton County, Georgia, Swink Manufacturing Company, Rowan County,
        N.C.; Travora Textiles, Graham and Haw River, N.C.; Windemere Knitting Mills, Albemarle,
        N.C.; and Wiscassett Mills, Albemarle, N.C. Other mills, not represented here by series,
        were related to the Cannon group, and information about them occasionally appears in the
        collection. These firms include: Amazon Cotton Mills, Thomasville, N.C.; Durham Hosiery
        Mills; Efird Manufacturing Co., Albemarle, N.C.; Tuscarora Cotton Mill, Mt. Pleasant, N.C.;
        Buck Creek Cotton Mills, Siluria, Ala.; and Paola Cotton Mills, Statesville, N.C.</p>
      <p>Basic information about these textile mills can be found in the annual volumes of
        Davidson's Textile Blue Book. The size and products of many of the factories varied over the
        years.</p>
      <p>The huge Cannon corporation also had related business interests and community involvements
        that are represented by organizations and record series in this collection. They include:
        Cannon Mills, Inc., the selling agency in New York City; Cannon of West Coast, Inc.; L. T.
        Barringer and Co., a cotton brokerage firm in Memphis, Tennessee; the Brown-Roberta
        Foundation, a community philanthropy; J. A. Skipwith and Co., cotton brokers at Concord,
        N.C.; Klumac Cotton Mills, Salisbury, N.C.; P. M. Morris Real Estate Company, Concord, N.C.;
        Rowan County Farm Life School; and the Trading and Commission Company, a selling agency and
        holding company.</p>
      <p>The series in this collection represent executives, offices, a department, subsidiary
        companies, affiliated companies, and related businesses and organizations. The general
        arrangement of the 47 series is: reference information; members of the Cannon family;
        executive offices; executives; a department; and numerous companies, businesses, and
        organizations, these arranged mostly alphabetically.</p>
      <p>The surviving files and volumes represent only a small percentage of the original archives.
        Some parts of the company have considerable papers in this collection, but no series is
        anywhere near complete. Some series are quite small. Record survival was random, but many
        important and useful files and account books are available.</p>
      <p>Information about particular topics, companies, and individuals is often scattered in a
        number of series in this collection, and the container list serves as a guide to many of
        them. It should be remembered that company activities may be reflected by bookkeeping
        entries in the account books whether or not relevant files are available. Because of the
        interlocking relationships of the various companies, information about one firm may not be
        exclusive to its own series.</p>

          <p>Correspondence, memoranda, legal and financial papers, reports, and volumes centering
            upon the founder of Cannon Mills. Important files relating to mill operations concern
            the early years of Buck Creek Cotton Mills at Siluria, Ala., and Cannon's management of
            Paola Cotton Mills at Statesville, N.C. There is considerable financial data and some
            correspondence for the New York office. A record book contains early production, cost,
            labor and other statistics. Overseer Joseph D. Bacon's reminiscences provide a vignette
            of J. W. Cannon's early years in management. T. C. Thompson, a builder and contractor,
            was associated with Cannon in Buck Creek Cotton Mills.</p>
          <p>Information about J. W. Cannon's finances and personal investments is extensive. It
            includes his dealing with H. Hentz and Co., J. S. Bache and Co., and the Farmers' Loan
            and Trust Co. of New York City. Trading in securities and commodities was considerable.
            There is also some record of other ventures such as real estate and oil production.</p>
          <p>Papers relating to Cannon and his family include wills, estate records, and financial
            documents and accounts. Files for the settlement of the estate of Mrs. Cannon's uncle,
            Aaron J. Bost, are extensive, and securities investments are itemized.</p>

          <p>Correspondence, memoranda, legal and financial papers, reports, and volumes relating to
            C. A. Cannon, the company's manager from 1921 to 1971. There are notable files for the
            advertising agencies of Young and Rubicam, N. W. Ayer and Son, and the Market Research
            Corporation of America. External public relations and industry concerns were expressed
            through such organizations as the American Cotton Manufacturers Association, American
            Cotton Manufacturers Institute, National Cotton Council, Textile Committee on Public
            Relations, and the Committee for a National Trade Policy. Lawsuits between Cannon and
            the Collector of Internal Revenue and the estate of William A. Stribling, a cotton
            buying and receiving agent, caused the compilation of considerable information and
            financial statistics about Cannon Mills and some of its subsidiary and related mills.
            There are also records from the antebellum Concord Steam Manufacturing Co.; the Odell
            Manufacturing Co.; Charles Cannon's investments and cash transactions; the securities
            investments of James W. Cannon and Mary Ella (Bost) Cannon; the estate of Thomas T.
            Smith, a former secretary of Cannon Manufacturing; the consolidation of 1928; and a
            lodge of Freemasons at Concord, N.C.</p>

          <p>These files are considerably more complete than those in the series for 1950. Larger
            files include: miscellaneous correspondence; several mills in the Cannon group,
            especially Central and Wiscassett; state and national industry organizations;
            Ewing-Thomas Corp. of Chester, Pa., and the U.S. government (New York Quartermaster
            Procurement Agency). many important writers and topics appear in the extensive
            miscellaneous correspondence files. Cannon, Swink, Ridenhour, Batte, and Haywood
            continue to be principals in the correspondence. Arranged alphabetically.</p>

          <p>Minute books of stockholders and directors and considerable financial information and
            scattered records for payroll, production, sales, tenants, consolidation with Cannon
            Mills, and construction. The account books are ledgers, journals, and cashbooks. James
            W. Cannon and his sons founded the mill in 1906. The factory, operator of 25,500
            spindles in 1927 producing warp yarns, became Cannon Mills' Plant No. 9 in 1928. Files
            arranged alphabetically and volumes shelved numerically.</p>

          <p>Stockholder records, charter and bylaws, minutes, scattered correspondence and
            financial papers of this textile mill founded at Salisbury, N.C., in 1895. Rare and
            unusual access to the operations of a textile factory is provided by the diary of
            Superintendent John C. Mason who managed Kesler. The Cannons and the Rev. Francis
            Johnstone Murdoch became stockholders and executives. In 1925 the mill had 27,456
            spindles and produced sheetings. During the consolidation of 1928 Kesler became Cannon
            Mills' Plant No. 7. Arranged alphabetically.</p>

          <p>Customer files, lawsuits, correspondence, financial statements, sales invoices, and
            weekly production and sales reports of this factory at Salisbury, N.C., that produced
            damask and rayon bedspreads. Klumac sold its goods through Cannon Mills in New York
            City, and Cannon also assisted with finishing work in North Carolina. Klumac had
            economic difficulties in the mid-1930s, went into receivership, and did not operate for
            several years. Cannon sued Klumac in 1934. The records document the Cannon-Klumac
            relationship and its difficulties. Arranged alphabetically.</p>

            was one of the earlier components of the Cannon textile empire. James W. Cannon and J.
            Frank Patterson established the factory at China Grove, Rowan Co., N.C., in 1893. The
            mill, operator of 11,056 spindles producing sheeting and yarns, became Cannon Mills
            Plant No. 8 in the consolidation of 1928. Records of the Patterson Store Company, a
            general store, contain the names and accounts of many millworkers. Extensive invoices
            and checkbook stubs provide a rare sample of the nuts and bolts operation of a textile
            mill during its early years as well as filling some bookkeeping gaps. Files arranged

          <p>Account books, clippings, cotton contracts, correspondence, financial papers, legal
            papers, and payroll and tax lists concern the management of the property, farm lands,
            and buildings in Rowan Co., N.C., of this textile mill incorporated in 1923 by William
            Joshua Swink and Charles A. Cannon but never built. Swink Manufacturing was dissolved in
            1931, and the partnership of Cannon and Swink took over its assets. Checkbook stubs
            record laborers' wages as well as other financial matters. Files arranged alphabetically
            and volumes shelved numerically.</p>
