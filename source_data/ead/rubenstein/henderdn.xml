      <head>Notes on Processing and Arrangement</head>
      <p>The arrangement of this collection has generally followed the system of organization used
        by Henderson's office. For Federal and State Agencies, Subject Files, and Committee Files,
        Henderson's staff started a new file each year. In each case these yearly files were
        consolidated into a comprehensive alphabetical file for the whole period, 1961-1976. Folder
        headings were left as they were given by Henderson's office except when clarification or
        more detail was necessary.</p>
      <p>Certain material in the original collection was discarded such as routine requests for
        publications, general information, autographs, pictures, flags, tickets to the White House,
        etc. Samples of orchestrated pressure mail and Henderson's responses were retained along
        with a count of the letters received, but repetitive copies were discarded. Case Files only
        for the letter <emph render="doublequote">C</emph> were retained. In the Military Academy
        Files, confidential files for individual applicants and appointees were destroyed. For the
        Post Office Files, samples were retained only for county seats and Morehead City.</p>
      <p>Photographs are scattered throughout the papers. Many are located in the Subject Files
        under the heading Photographs. Most of these are undated and were left in order as Henderson
        arranged them. They roughly correspond to years.</p>
      <p>When papers were in fairly good order, non-dated Items have been left in sequence where
        they appeared. In some instances where papers were so disarranged that sequence gave no clue
        to the dates of such Items, they were placed at the beginning of the folder.</p>
      <p>Dates on the folder headings indicate the period of the working papers, but these papers
        might contain printed material written at an earlier date. Dated printed material was left
        with the papers in the context in which it was used. This material is often background
        information, copies of older bills, laws, and regulations.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The David Newton Henderson Papers contain the office files of Congressman Henderson when he
        was the U.S. Representative for the Third District of North Carolina. The papers span from
        1930 to 1976, but the bulk of the papers covers Henderson's years in office, 1961-1976.
        Henderson's predecessor, Congressman Graham A. Barden, left Henderson many papers on ongoing
        business, especially local projects.</p>
      <p>The Henderson Papers contain correspondence, printed material, speeches, invitations,
        newspaper clippings, photographs, newsletters, financial statements, legislative reports and
        notes, and drafts of bills. The great majority of this collection is correspondence which
        Henderson's office exchanged with constituents, legislative officials, and officials of
        federal and state agencies.</p>
      <p>The papers are divided into the following fifteen series:</p>
      <p>Campaign Files</p>
      <p>Case Files</p>
      <p>Committee Files</p>
      <p>Correspondence: Answer Copies</p>
      <p>County Project Files</p>
      <p>Engagements</p>
      <p>Federal and State Agencies</p>
      <p>Legislation</p>
      <p>Military Academy Files</p>
      <p>Newsletters and News Releases</p>
      <p>Newspaper Clippings</p>
      <p>Post Office Files</p>
      <p>Speeches</p>
      <p>Subject Files</p>
      <p>Oversize Box</p>
      <p>The largest series are Committee Files, County Project Files, Federal and State Agencies,
        Legislation, and Subject Files. The Committee Files contain material relating to Henderson's
        various committee and subcommittee memberships and reflect the actual creation of
        legislation. The Legislation Series contains drafts of specific bills and legislative
        reports and notes. Subject Files contain mostly constituent mail on legislation, current
        issues, and various subjects. County Project Files concern projects and local affairs in the
        Third District. The Federal and State Agencies Series reflects Henderson's role as an
        intermediary between constituents' problems and requests and the appropriate governmental
        agency which could deal with their problems.</p>
      <p>There is some overlap among series. For example, using the broad subject Agriculture, a
        constituent's letter supporting an agricultural price-support bill would appear under
        Subject Files. Agriculture. Drafts of that specific bill might be under Legislation.
        Material on an agricultural cooperative project in the Third District would be in the County
        Project Files. A constituent's request for exemption from certain federal regulations
        regarding crop measurement would be under Federal and State Agencies. Agriculture,
        Department of. For more information summarizing the contents of each category see the
        introductions at the beginning of each section in the inventory.</p>
      <p>The papers reflect many types of public opinion: organized and repetitive pressure mail,
        professional lobbying activities of national interest groups, letters ranging from
        semi-literate constituents to well-known local and national leaders. The papers show a
        definite paper spiral during the 1960s and 1970s with the volume of Henderson's files
        increasing yearly.</p>
      <p>The Henderson Papers illustrate many national trends of the 1960s and 1970s. Henderson's
        work on the Post Office and Civil Service and the Public Works committees made him
        instrumental in matters of national importance and brought him correspondence from around
        the nation. These papers particularly reveal trends in federal employment practices in the
        1960s and 1970s. The papers contain much material about the reorganization of the Post
        Office Department into the Postal Service in 1969-1970. The papers reveal public opinion and
        legislative trends on such issues as civil rights, the Vietnamese War, the energy crisis of
        the early 1970s, and the Watergate affair. Henderson illustrates well the position of a
        conservative southern Democratic congressman voting against all civil rights legislation,
        opposing extension and raising of the minimum wage, federal aid to education, the War
        Against Poverty, and foreign aid. He consistently supported the presidents' positions on
        Vietnam, <emph render="doublequote">right-to-Work</emph> laws, and agricultural price
        supports.</p>
      <p>The Henderson Papers contain rich information on local interests, affairs, and
        personalities in the Third District of North Carolina. Henderson vigorously supported local
        interests in Congress. He vehemently opposed restrictions on tobacco advertising and other
          <emph render="doublequote">anti-tobacco</emph> legislation. Henderson's correspondence and
        campaign material reveal the network of the Democratic political machinery in eastern North
        Carolina and his relationship with the local power structure.</p>
      <p>Specific subjects are discussed in more detail in the inventory.</p>

          <p>Contains correspondence, notes, and newspaper clippings concerning Henderson's
            congressional campaigns, 1960-1974. Henderson concentrated most of his time and
            attention to the Democratic primary in May of each election year. There is much less
            material about the November election. The Campaign Files contain many lists of electoral
            officials, party leaders, and targeted support groups, e.g. teachers, veterans. The
            papers reveal the rising importance of television in political campaigns of the mid to
            late 1960s.</p>

          <p>The Case Files formed a massive part of Henderson's office files. They consist of
            correspondence from constituents and Henderson's responses concerning problems and
            requests of all sorts such as pensions, military transfers, job requests, etc. Since
            these papers are very routine and not topical in nature, a representative sample has
            been retained only for the letter <emph render="doublequote">C</emph>, a large letter
            which includes a wide range of ethnic groups.</p>

                <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
                <p>In 1969 through 1970 the Post Office Department experienced a major
                  reorganization. First introduced in 1969 as H.R. 4, this reform was finally
                  implemented in 1970 as H.R. 17070. This legislation converted the Post Office
                  Department from a Cabinet-level department to an independent establishment in the
                  executive branch of government. This independence necessitated reorganizing rates
                  so that revenues of the Postal Service as a whole met expenses. The bills provided
                  the framework for collective bargaining by postal employees, and enhanced the pay
                  scale and advancement opportunities. One oversized item is located in oversized
                  box at end of collection.</p>

          <p>This series provides a complete record of Henderson's outgoing correspondence from 1968
            through 1976. These files are composed of second carbon copies of outgoing mail. The
            first copy was attached to the correspondent's letter and filed away to its appropriate
            place. For each year the letters are filed within alphabetical folders such as all
            surnames beginning with letters Sl-So are in a folder so labeled. Within the folder
            labeled Sl-So, the letters are arranged not alphabetically but chronologically during
            the year.</p>

          <p>Contains correspondence, notes, newspaper clippings and printed material concerning
            projects and local affairs in the Third Congressional District. Much of the material
            relates to projects such as urban renewal, housing developments, anti-poverty programs,
            water and sewer projects, the construction of recreational facilities, hospitals, and
            public buildings, etc. Henderson's correspondence with federal agencies, local
            officials, and interested constituents reflects his position as an intermediary between
            local interests and federal financing. The County Project Files contain a considerable
            amount of material from the office of Graham H. Barden. This material is indicated in
            the inventory by dates prior to 1961.</p>

          <p>Includes invitations received by Henderson's office and correspondence and printed
            material relating to accepted engagements. This material illustrates lobbying efforts of
            both local and national interest groups, businesses and organizations. These papers also
            reveal something of Henderson's daily schedule. Materials were left in the arrangement
            as they were filed by Henderson's office. Accepted invitations were filed by following
            the date of the engagements. Declined invitations were filed as they crossed Henderson's
            desk, i.e. at the time when Henderson's staff responded to the invitation.</p>

          <p>Contains mainly correspondence reflecting Henderson's role as an intermediary between
            constituents' problems and appropriate federal and state agencies which could resolve
            those problems. There is some expression of opinion by constituents over the activities,
            regulations, and administration of such agencies. These papers are similar to the Case
            Files in nature. Folder headings for North Carolina departments and agencies are
            preceded by <emph render="doublequote">N.C.</emph> Those without this indication are
            federal agencies. Each agency is listed alphabetically even if it is part of a larger
            department or agency. State and federal agencies are filed separately.</p>

          <p>Contains copies and drafts of specific bills, informative material about the bills,

            legislation. For public opinion on bills, see Subject Files. This category is not a
            complete file of every bill passing through Congress during Henderson's years; much of
            this legislation reflects Henderson's committee memberships and bills of local interest.
            The papers are arranged by Congress and session and specific bill number. A
            comprehensive listing of the title and number of each bill in this category is located

            affairs, current legislation, and Henderson's policies and views. Frequent topics
            included civil rights, Vietnam, and foreign aid. The news releases were bulletins sent
            to newspapers and radio and television stations. This series also contains letters from
            constituents responding to the newsletters.</p>

          <p>The largest and most diverse category in the Henderson Papers, the Subject Files
            contain correspondence and printed material concerning a wide range of subjects and
            legislative items. They include much public opinion on current legislation arranged both
            under the name of the issue itself (e.g. Gun Control) and under the name of the standing
            committee through which the legislation passed (e.g. Judiciary). There is similar
            material under Gun Control and Judiciary so both subject and committee listing should be
            checked. There is also much material on general subjects and administrative matters.</p>

            <p>Concerns controversy between the U.S. Department of Defense and local residents over
              the implementation of the Gesell Report. The Report called for integrated facilities
              for use of servicemen in communities adjacent to military complexes. If compliance to
              this request did not occur, the report directed military officials to declare the
              local communities off-limits to base personnel thus disrupting local economies.</p>

              Henderson asked that these be sent to him for use in governmental action against the
              solicitors.</p>

            <p>In 1964 journalists charged that several Southern congressmen--particularly the North
              Carolina delegation--made the votes for the president's economic opportunity program
              contingent on the expulsion of Adam Yarmolinski from the administration of the
              program. These congressmen reportedly suspected Yarmolinski, a Jewish liberal of
              Russian descent, of subversion.</p>
