         <p>The Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University was established for the study of
            the documentary process. "Indivisible: Stories of American Community" was a national
            documentary project which took place primarily during 1999-2001, and was sponsored by
            the Center for Documentary Studies in partnership with the Center for Creative
            Photography at the University of Arizona. The project captured the experiences of
            individuals participating in grassroots community organizations and activism in twelve
            American communities at the end of the 20th century.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The records of the documentary project "Indivisible: Stories of American Community" span
            the dates 1988-2002, with the bulk of the collection dating from 1999 to 2002, the
            primary timeframe for the project. Through documentary photographs and oral histories,
            project records, videos, and other materials, the collection documents the social
            conditions in twelve American communities as well as the history of the project, which
            explored civil activism, struggle, and change in the following locations: the North
            Pacific Coast of Alaska; Ithaca, N.Y.; San Francisco, California; Navajo Nation, Arizona
            and New Mexico; Eau Claire, South Carolina; Delray Beach, Florida; Western North
            Carolina; Stony Brook, N.Y.; San Juan, Texas; Chicago, Illinois; Philadelphia,
            Pennsylvania; and the Yaak Valley, Montana. Each project is fully described in its entry
            in this collection guide. The project co-directors were Tom Rankin of the Center for
            Documentary Studies and Trudy Wilner Stack of the Center for Creative Photography. The
            project was also supported by the Pew Charitable Trusts, the NEA, and other
            agencies.</p>
         <p>The photographs in this collection, most of which formed part of a traveling exhibit,
            were taken chiefly during 1999 by twelve well-known documentary and landscape
            photographers working in partnership with project oral history interviewers. The
            photographers are Dawoud Bey, Bill Burke, Debbie Fleming Caffery, Lucy Capehart, Lynn
            Davis, Terry Evans, Lauren Greenfield, Joan Liftin, Reagan Louie, Danny Lyon, Sylvia
            Plachy, and Eli Reed. Their images capture the experiences of individuals participating
            in grassroots initiatives addressing American social issues such as housing, immigration
            (in particular, Haitians in Florida), the natural environment, race relations, youth
            empowerment, and economic and cultural development, and others.</p>
         <p>Also preserved in this collection are detailed oral histories recorded in each
            community, with audio recordings and transcriptions; information on the traveling
            exhibit; and materials on other project outcomes, including a hardbound large-format
            book of the images, a postcard exhibit, a guide for educators, booklets and other
            publications on community organizing, and radio and television programs. Other files
            document the establishment of research archives based on the documentary project's
            output, at Duke, in Arizona, and in each of the twelve communities.</p>
         <p>The collection is arranged into three series: Audiovisual Resources, Photographs, and
            Project Files. Audiovisual Resources houses the interview tapes as well as other media
            associated with the project; Photographs includes photographic prints, most of which
            accompanied the project book and exhibition; Project Files houses the interview records
            as well as tape lists, logs, and transcripts in both paper and digital formats.
            Additional supporting materials found in the Project Files Series include postcards and
            videocassette tapes from exhibits; a CD-ROM of the 2001 website; field notes in paper
            and digital format; and other office files generated by the project and its staff,
            including Tom Rankin, one of the project co-directors.</p>

               <p>Prints in various sizes, chiefly in black and white, taken by documentary
                  photographers in project locations: Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida,

                  contextual notes have been taken from the original source. Unless otherwise noted,
                  images were also published in the volume, Indivisible: Stories of American
                  Community, and formed the traveling exhibit by the same name. Each print is
                  prefaced by a unique identification number assigned by the photographers. Arranged
                  in subseries alphabetically by photographer's last name.</p>
