      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Table-top role-playing games (RPGs) are a type of game where players create or assume the
        role of various characters and collaborate to imagine and build a story or quest. Each
        players' characterization offers guidelines and expectations for the abilities and
        tendencies of their character, and their proposed actions succeed or fail based on the
        game's established rules and statistics. One player may serve as a gamemaster to guide
        fellow players through the game and introduce new challenges or twists to the story.</p>
      <p>Modern role-playing games emerged in the 1970s, with the first commercially available game,
          <title render="italic" type="simple">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</title>, published in 1974. It
        quickly became very popular, leading to copycats and competitors as well as enabling the
        development of RPG supporting material, such as campaign sets, miniatures and playing
        pieces, new literature, and fan magazines. Other popular games quickly followed, such as
          <title render="italic" type="simple">Advanced Dungeons and Dragons</title> in 1977, <title
          render="italic" type="simple">Traveller </title>in 1977, <title render="italic"
          type="simple">RuneQuest</title> in 1978, <title render="italic" type="simple">Call of
          Cthulhu</title> in 1981, and <title render="italic" type="simple">James Bond</title> in
        1983.</p>
      <p>RPGs continued to grow and evolved through the late 1980s and 1990s. General game systems
        emerged, allowing for a single set of rules that worked with any setting. Another notable
        milestone was the release of <title render="italic" type="simple">Magic: The
          Gathering</title> in 1993, which proved very popular and resulted in more spin-offs and
        competition in the field of collectible card games. Early computer games frequently adopted
        or mimicked RPG rules, eliminating the need for a gamemaster and increasing the game's
        speed. Many contemporary video games share their terminology, settings, and game mechanics
        with pen-and-paper RPGs.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>This collection includes thousands of game books, boxed sets, figurines, cards, magazines
        and serials. It also includes a small amount of manuscript material from the Murrays' own
        campaign notes and records. The materials have been divided into series based on format:
        Boxed Games (BG); Modules, Manuals, and Campaign Volumes (M); Miniatures and Pieces (P);
        Cards (C); Serials (S); and Manuscripts (MS). Within each series, materials have been sorted
        into their various game worlds and settings as best as possible. Along with Box and Volume
        numbers, barcodes for each item are included to ease research requests from Duke's offsite
        storage facility. Due to the vast number of games and the wide variety of research interests
        for this collection, a downloadable spreadsheet is available for researchers interested in
        browsing and sorting the games in different ways, such as by year or by box.</p>

      <p><emph render="bold">Please note:</emph> The collection contains loose parts such as dice,
        tokens, figurines, cards, etc. Some materials may be sealed in original packaging. Packaged
        materials in Miniatures series are intended to remain in sealed packaging. Please consult
        Research Services staff for assistance with removal of other materials from sealed
        packaging. Please return materials to original packaging whenever possible. Consult Research
        Services staff for assistance if materials cannot be returned to original packaging.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Boxed Games (BG) series</emph> includes games from a range of
        worlds, as well as a large number of general games that date from the early 1970s to the
        mid-2000s. Large sub-series within the Boxed Games series include game settings and worlds
        like <title render="italic" type="simple">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</title>, <title
          render="italic" type="simple">Forgotten Realms</title>, <title render="italic"
          type="simple">James Bond</title>, <title render="italic" type="simple"
        >DragonLance</title>, <title render="italic" type="simple">RuneQuest</title>, <title
          render="italic" type="simple">Star Trek</title>, and <title render="italic" type="simple"
          >Supremacy</title>; but, there are many more from a large number of different systems.
        Boxed Games typically include campaign books and characterization sheets, grids or maps for
        game play, die, and rule books.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Modules, Manuals, and Campaign Volumes (M) series</emph> is the
        largest series in the collection, with over 2300 distinct volumes from numerous game worlds
        and settings. The series includes a variety of publications, ranging from traditional
        modules with a plot and characters included, to manuals with lists of creatures or
        characters, to reference guides for various game worlds. Many companies published only
        volumes, with no accompanying boxed game, and so there are a large number of titles that
        have no correlation to the Boxed Games series. The largest game worlds or settings
        represented in this series are <title render="italic" type="simple">Advanced Dungeons &amp;
          Dragons</title>, <title render="italic" type="simple">Call of Cthulhu</title>, <title
          render="italic" type="simple">Cyberpunk</title>, <title render="italic" type="simple"
          >Dungeons &amp; Dragons</title>, <title render="italic" type="simple">Forgotten
          Realms</title>, <title render="italic" type="simple">Middle-Earth</title>, and <title
          render="italic" type="simple">Traveller</title>; but, there are many, many more from
        different game worlds as well as independent, one-time games.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Miniatures and Pieces (P) series</emph> includes packaged and loose
        miniatures collected by the Murrays from a number of different companies. Most are generic
        and not attached to a particular game or game brand, although there are hundreds that were
        intended for playing with games like <title render="italic" type="simple">Advanced Dungeons
          and Dragons</title>, <title render="italic" type="simple">Call of Cthulhu</title>, DC or
        Marvel Superheroes, or <title render="italic" type="simple">Lord of the Rings</title>. Along
        with metal miniatures, the series also includes other various types of gameplay aids,
        including settings guides, grids, and miscellany. A portion of this series consists of
        unpackaged, handpainted miniatures that have been specially housed for preservation.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Serials (S) series</emph> contains fanzines and magazines collected
        by the Murrays relating to RPGs and RPG culture. Most magazine runs are incomplete and date
        from the late 1970s to the mid-2000s; the boxlist includes details about which issues are
        present in the collection.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Cards (C) series</emph> includes cards from several years of <title
          render="italic" type="simple">Magic: The Gathering</title>, as well as smaller amounts of
        cards of other games such as <title render="italic" type="simple">Legend of the Five
          Rings</title>, <title render="italic" type="simple">New Aeon</title>, <title
          render="italic" type="simple">Sim City</title>, <title render="italic" type="simple"
          >Spellfire</title>, <title render="italic" type="simple">On the Edge</title>, and <title
          render="italic" type="simple">Jyhad</title>.</p>

          <p>The Modules, Manuals, and Campaign Volumes series includes books designed to accompany
            or enable role-playing in a variety of worlds. A volume typically includes campaign
            settings, character guides, game system rules, or reference tools for players. Worlds
            represented in this series include Dungeons and Dragons, Advanced Dungeons and Dragons,
            Birthright, Cyberpunk, Call of Cthulhu, Dragon Lance, Earthdawn, Forgotten Realms,
            Middle Earth, Ravenloft, Spell Jammer, and many more.</p>

          <head>Arrangement note</head>
          <p>Most volumes are individually numbered and barcoded, unless they included extra
            components that required them to be housed in a box. There are 6 boxes of volumes
            (M1-M6) included in this series. All volumes (regardless of volume or box number) have
            been arranged by alphabetically by game world, then chronologically by date. General
            volumes that have no identifiable "world" are listed at the end in alphabetical order. A
            spreadsheet is available for researchers who are interested in sorting the games in a
            different way.</p>

          <p>The Miniatures series consists of small playing pieces created by several companies,
            which were designed to be used as part of table top role-playing games. Many miniatures
            were deliberately generic, and were not designated for any particular brand of game.
            Most miniatures dating from the 1980s were very small, on a 15mm or 25mm scale, and were
            made with lead-based metals. Later miniatures (dating from the 1990s) were made with
            lead-free pewter or plastic. Players could purchase the packs of miniatures and then
            paint them, which along with adding color served to make the pieces more durable for
            long-term use.</p>
          <p>The miniatures in this collection represent a wide range of themes and companies. The
            majority of the miniatures are intended for play with dungeon-themed role-playing games.
            Many miniatures represent magical characters such as dragons, monsters, warriors, elves,
            knights, gods, or princesses. Other games represented include <title render="italic"
              type="simple">Traveller</title>, <title render="italic" type="simple">Call of
              Cthulhu</title>, <title render="italic" type="simple">Indiana Jones</title>, comic
            superheroes from both DC Comics and Marvel Comics, <title render="italic" type="simple"
              >The Lord of the Rings</title>, <title render="italic" type="simple"
            >RuneQuest</title>, and <title render="italic" type="simple">BattleTech</title>. The
            majority of the miniatures in this collection are from the Ral Partha, Grenadier Models,
            and Citadel Miniatures companies.</p>
          <p>The series consists of approximately 660 unopened packs of miniatures. Miscellaneous
            supplementary materials are also included in this series, such as maps, exansion sets,
            and blank character cards. Items have been arranged alphabetically by company, and by
            series within those companies.</p>
          <p>The series also contains hundreds of hand-painted loose miniatures, some of which were
            handpainted by the Murrays.</p>
