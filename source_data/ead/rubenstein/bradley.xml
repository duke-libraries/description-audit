            Correspondence, memoranda, minutes, reports, speeches and writings, newsletters,
            financial reports, pamphlets, clippings, flyers, and printed materials, primarily
            focusing on women's organizations in which Mrs. Bradley held leadership positions. The
            majority of the materials pertain to the League of Women Voters of the United States,
            particularly as they relate to her chairing its Foreign Policy Committee. The collection
            also documents efforts to pass the Equal Rights Amendment through the North Carolina
            State Legislature in the 1970s. Other organizations highlighted are the U.S. National
            Commission for UNESCO, the Women's Equity Action League of North Carolina, and the
            Women's Forum of North Carolina. Also includes copies of the LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS,
            (DURHAM, N.C.) BULLETIN. A common goal which runs through many of the papers was her
            effort to improve the condition of women legally, economically, and
            politically.</abstract>

         <p>Processing Note: The papers were weeded for duplicate materials as well as for printed
            material of various types including runs of periodicals (with an exception being made
            for the Bulletin published by the League of Women Voters of Durham, N.C.), published

         <p>Some League of Women Voters of the United States (LWVUS), UNESCO, and Women's Bureau
            materials were removed from the collection because they exist elsewhere in the archives
            of the organizations. Some LWVUS materials are located at the Library of Congress and at
            the League of Women Voters national office. Records of the Women's Bureau are housed at
            the National Archives, while records of UNESCO are located at the United Nations. Some
            of these materials were kept with the collection, however, if they were deemed necessary
            for documenting Bradley's role in the organization.</p>
         <p>Some ephemeral printed materials were also retained if it was not obvious that they
            would be maintained by other repositories.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The papers of Winifred Gail Soules Bradley span the period 1952 to 1982 with the bulk of
            the material dating from 1965 through the 1970s. The focus of the collection is the
            various women's organizations to which Bradley belonged and in which she held leadership
            positions.</p>
         <p>The collection includes correspondence, memoranda, minutes, reports, speeches and
            writings, newsletters, financial reports, pamphlets, clippings, flyers, and printed
            materials. It is organized chiefly alphabetically by name of organization, committee, or
            concern.</p>
         <p>The organization primarily represented is the League of Women Voters in which Bradley
            held local, state, and national office. Files pertaining to the League are subdivided by
            the League of Women Voters, Durham, N.C., League of Women Voters, N.C., and the League
            of Women Voters, United States. These files are further subdivided by committees,
            conferences, and issues in which Bradley held an office or was involved. Within these
            subgroups, the papers are arranged in chronological order. The majority of materials in
            this file pertains to her offices at the national level, in particular her service as
            chair of the League of Women Voters of the United States (LWVUS) Foreign Policy
            Committee from 1967 to 1970 and her tenure as First Vice President from 1970 to
            1974.</p>
         <p>Papers relating to the Foreign Policy Committee include memos from Bradley to state
            league presidents, handwritten notes, reports and speeches (some of these made by
            Bradley), position papers, and newsletters. Among the topics addressed while she was
            Foreign Policy committee chairman were foreign aid, biological and chemical warfare, and
            United States trade policies.</p>
         <p>Bradley's positions as First Vice President of the LWVUS and Chair of the Foreign Policy
            Committee gave her several opportunities to have a highly visible role in the League's
            activities, some of which are reflected in the collection. They include speeches she
            made before the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee in support of foreign economic aid
            in 1968 and before the House Ways and Means Committee regarding U.S. trade policy and
            the Trade Expansion Act of 1968. She also represented the League on a fact-finding
            mission to Japan in 1972 and at the Hemispheric Conference for Women in Miami in 1976.
            Documentation and papers relating to both trips are included in the collection.</p>
         <p>In 1971, Bradley was appointed by President Nixon to serve as a member of the board of
            the National Institute for Consumer Justice. The board's report provided findings and
            recommendations concerning the adequacy of existing procedures for resolving disputes
            arising out of consumer transactions, particularly as they related to small claims
            courts.</p>
         <p>Bradley's involvement with the Overseas Education Fund (OEF) also added an international
            component to her work with the LWVUS. She became a life trustee of the organization. The
            mission of the OEF was to help women of the third world become integrated into the
            socioeconomic development of their societies, as well as to further understanding in the
            United States of issues as they related to women in development. Bradley also
            represented the LWVUS on the United States National Commission for UNESCO (United
            Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization). Papers related to this
            organization contain reports by Bradley to the LWVUS about the group and to her
            activities as chair of its Status of Women Committee. One of these involvements was a
            Mid-Decade World Conference held in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1980, which grew out of the
            United Nations Decade for Women (1975-1985). The papers indicate that Bradley
            contributed to the development of this conference by devising a basic plan to involve
            nongovernmental organizations in the conference. </p>
         <p>The collection contains several speeches Bradley made before League groups both while
            she was President of the North Carolina League of Women Voters and also when she was
            First Vice-President of the LWVUS. However, there is not very much material relating to
            her tenure as president of the League of Women Voters of North Carolina from 1962 to
            1965. Some of this material has been donated to the North Carolina State Division of
            Archives and History and to the state league office in Raleigh, North Carolina. What
            material there is primarily concerns the League's efforts to revise the structure and
            operations of the Judicial Department of North Carolina, particularly the North Carolina
            court system.</p>
         <p>The League of Women Voters of Durham, N.C. Bulletin forms the bulk of the material
            relating to the local league with which Bradley was involved. The Bulletin spans the
            years 1952 to 1982 and offers insight into League activities at the local level. Bradley
            was President of the Durham League from 1957 to 1959. Other materials from the Durham
            League include information about local workshops, general information pertaining to
            Durham and local issues in the areas of housing, transportation, and law
            enforcement.</p>
         <p>The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) File (1971-1982) chiefly relates to efforts to ratify
            passage of the ERA in the North Carolina State Legislature. These papers particularly
            reflect those attempts which were made in the state from 1974 to 1979. The organization
            most prominently represented is North Carolinians United for ERA (NCUERA) which was
            comprised of a coalition of forty-three groups in North Carolina. NCUERA was apparently
            referred to by several names, including ERA United Inc., N. C. Coalition for Passage of
            the ERA, and the North Carolina Equal Rights Amendment Ratification Coalition. Offices
            Bradley held include Public Relations Coordinator for ERA United, 1974-1975 and lst
            Vice-President of NCUERA, 1978-1979. The files contain handwritten notes, speeches made
            by Bradley, correspondence, minutes, and printed materials generated to garner support
            for the ERA amendment. They also include personal testimonies from persons, who were
            surveyed by Bradley during her tenure as Public Relations Coordinator, regarding why
            they were working for passage of the ERA as well as samples of quotes from persons
            representing different groups who were against passage of the ERA.</p>
         <p>Two other North Carolina women's groups in which she held leadership positions were WEAL
            (Women's Equity Action League) and Women's Forum (WF) of North Carolina. Correspondence,
            minutes, and newsletters relating to both groups are located in the collection and cover
            the years 1977 to 1982. Both organizations were affiliated with national organizations.
            Bradley was President of the North Carolina division of WEAL in 1976 and Vice-President
            of WF of North Carolina in 1979. WEAL was interested in promoting economic opportunity
            and pressing for enforcement of anti-discrimination laws against women. It was one of
            the forty-three groups that joined together to form North Carolinians United for the
            ERA.</p>
         <p>The WF of North Carolina was comprised of women deemed to be high achievers and leaders.
            Papers indicate that in order to become eligible for membership women had to have
            influence in the community, have a constituency or make achievements in and beyond their
            fields. Additionally, members were to have made a commitment to changing the status of
            women. The papers document considerable debate about eligibility requirements and
            lengthy discussions about whether or not proposed members should be accepted. Some of
            the membership proposals are included in the collection.</p>
         <p>While most of the collection pertains to volunteer organizations with which Bradley was
            involved, two other groups are represented in which Bradley held paid positions. She
            worked as a fundraising consultant for the N. C. Rape Crisis Association, Inc. and as a
            staff member of the Older Americans Volunteer Program Training Project (OAVP). OAVP was
            housed in the Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development in the Duke University
            Medical Center. There are two folders of miscellaneous items, including the work by
            Bradley, ABC's of Fundraising for Volunteer Organizations, speeches she gave (but it is
            unclear for which organizations they were made), and pamphlets and bibliographies
            concerning legal, insurance, and child care issues affecting women.</p>
         <p>There is very little personal material relating to Mrs. Bradley or to her family in the
            collection. Some of the papers indicate she and her husband, Dr. David Bradley, worked
            together for the passage of the ERA in North Carolina and that they traveled abroad to
            conferences sponsored by the Wilton Park organization. [Wilton Park is described as a
            British organization to promote greater cooperation in Europe and the West and to offer
            those influencing opinion in their own countries an opportunity to exchange views on
            political, economic, and social questions.] Dr. Bradley was for many years on the
            faculty of the Duke University Religion Department.</p>
         <p>A common goal which characterizes the various organizations and committees in which
            Bradley established herself as a leader was to improve the condition of women legally,
            economically, and politically. Through her many efforts she worked toward this goal at
            the local, state, national, and international levels.</p>
