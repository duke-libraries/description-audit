    <head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The collection includes several different series, including Stiles' personal and family papers; projects and writings; correspondence; photographs; and an artist archive documenting her correspondence and relationship with over 60 different contemporary and modern artists from around the world. </p><p>The <emph render="bold">Personal and Family Papers</emph> series includes scrapbooks, photographs, and albums of Stiles family history, dating back to the early 20th century and including much of her extended family. The majority of the series consists of family correspondence between Stiles and her parents, siblings, ex-husbands, and other extended family members. Also included are Stiles' diaries, poetry, schoolwork, and other personal papers.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Perjovschi Project</emph> series largely relates to the <title type="simple" render="doublequote">States of Mind</title> exhibit that Stiles curated for the Nasher Museum of Art in 2007, highlighting the art of Dan and Lia Perjovschi. The couple's relationship with Stiles is also documented in this series, which includes correspondence between them, as well as original art, books sent to her, and details about their earlier visits to Duke and Stiles' visits to Romania in the 1990s.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Artist Archive</emph> series represents the bulk of the collection, and is Stiles' archive of correspondence, documentation, interviews, and other interactions with over 60 modern and contemporary artists from around the world. This series frequently focuses on the Destruction in Art Symposium (DIAS), and many of the original participants are represented here. Artists and groups have been arranged in alphabetical order, but on occasion, multiple artists are in the same box.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Photographs</emph> series includes a wide range of items, including personal and family photographs of Stiles and her family, photographs taken by Stiles during her trips around the world, and photographs by other people of the DIAS movement. Also included are some scrapbooks and other fragile materials from Stiles' childhood.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Writings and Projects</emph> series is focused largely on Stiles' research and artwork, and dates from her early childhood through recent research as a professor at Duke. Included are details and ephemera from her performance art and exhibitions, such as the <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Romeo Drawing Book</title> and cassette tapes from her <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Questions</title> installation. Also contains her Ph.D. dissertation. </p><p><emph render="bold">Journals and Magazines</emph> is a series that includes zines, newsletters, and other periodicals that Stiles collected throughout her life. Many of these publications lasted only 1 or 2 issues. A notable portion of this series is the Apexart.org publications and the DIA Center for the Arts brochures, both of which include item-level description below.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Name Files</emph> series is another large series that includes small amounts of correspondence, brochures, clippings, and communications from a variety of artists, family members, colleagues, and galleries. This series does not include Stiles' communications with artists represented in the Artist Archive series. It is foldered alphabetically. </p><p>The <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials</emph> series includes videotapes and recordings collected by Stiles from various artists promoting their work.</p><p><emph render="bold">Other Artist Writings</emph> includes articles and writings by people other than Stiles; she collected them in the course of her research.</p><p><emph render="bold">Posters and Oversize Materials</emph> include large items from a variety of sources in the collection. Frequently this series deals with materials that have been pulled from other series for preservation and housing.</p>  </scopecontent>

an archive of her correspondence and interactions with artists from around the world. She met many of them through her research on the art of destruction and trauma. The majority of this material is correspondence between the artists and Stiles. Boxes will also often include postcards and gallery catalogs advertising performances or shows, as well as examples of original art, memorabilia from the artists' work or activities, books or printed materials, and personalized gifts for Stiles.</p><p>Materials are listed below in alphabetical order by artist or group name, occasionally putting boxes out of sequential order. Some boxes include more than one artist, meaning that some box numbers have been repeated as each artist is listed in their place alphabetically.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref135_c2h"
