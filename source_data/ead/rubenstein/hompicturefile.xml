            University Medical Library, the History of Medicine Picture File holds thousands of
            small and large images organized into series for individuals, places, and subjects
            related to the history of medicine and medical practice. The great majority portray
            notable physicians, scientists, naturalists, philosophers, and other individuals with
            important links to medicine. Places featured include hospitals and other institutions of
            medicine, and scenes in specific locations related to events in medical history. The
            subject categories cover many topics, with the largest groups including advertising,
            anatomy, caricatures, cartoons, pediatrics, physicians, and surgery. Predominant formats
            are engravings, lithographs, print materials (such as posters, clippings, and
            postcards), and many modern photographic reproductions of older works; there are also
            albumen photographs, negatives, slide reproductions, and other image formats found
            throughout the files. Forms part of the History of Medicine Collections at Duke

            purchases from various individuals, many of whom were affiliated with Duke University
            and the School of Medicine; among the most frequent donors were the late Dr. Josiah

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Assembled by the staff of the Duke University Medical Library, the History of Medicine
            Picture File offers thousands of images of individuals, places, and subjects dating from
            the 1500s to 2002, with the great majority portraying physicians, scientists, nurses,
            and other individuals related to the history or practice of medicine. Places featured
            include hospitals and other institutions of medicine, and scenes related to events in
            medical history. Subject categories include advertising, anatomy, books, caricature,
            childbirth, embryology, medical instruments, pediatrics, physicians, and surgery, among
            many others.</p>
         <p>Most of the images measure in size under 10x12 inches, but there are approximately 500
            larger pieces. The predominant formats are engravings, lithographs, cartoons, clippings
            from magazines and newspapers, and modern photographic prints, but there are also
            albumen photographs and other image formats found throughout the files. Items were
            acquired by the Duke Medical Library from various sources over many decades and
            functioned as a vertical file for library students and researchers.</p>
         <p>The oversize items range in size from 11x15 to 23x30 inches, and offer a varied
            assemblage of portraits, caricatures, posters, broadsides, and reproductions of artwork,
            in black-and-white and in color. Items include portraits and scenes with notable
            physicians; illustrations of various medical practices, procedures, and instruments;
            anatomical views, some possibly as early as the 17th century; medical advertisements and
            promotional literature; depictions of events in medical history in Europe and North
            America; caricatures; 20th century illustrations for book covers; and many other
            topics.</p>
         <p>Images and prints are often accompanied by reproduction negatives and slides created by
            Medical Center Library staff. Many of the images in this collection were also scanned by
            Medical Library staff and are available through the Medical Center Library &amp;

               <p>Series contains images of significant anatomists, chemists, physicians,
                  biologists, and other individuals in the field of medicine, arranged
                  alphabetically by last name. Most depict 19th century men, primarily from European
                  nations, particularly Germany, England, France, and Italy, and from North America,
                  but there are also individuals active as early as the 15th century and as late as
                  the 20th century. In many cases there are multiple images of the same individual
                  in the folder.</p>
               <p>The predominant formats are engravings, lithographs, modern black-and-white
                  photographs, and printed images (chiefly clippings on glossy paper), but there are
                  other formats present such as albumen prints and negatives. Oftentimes the image
                  is a modern photographic reproduction of an engraving, painting, sculpture, or
                  other work. Images are also often accompanied by a slide or negative reproduction
                  created as far back as the 1960s by Duke University Medical Center Library staff.
                  Sizes range from small prints ranging from 2x3 to 10x12 inches, housed in
                  manuscript boxes, to oversize items in flat boxes up to 23x30 inches. The sizes of
                  the larger boxes are given in the container inventory.</p>

               <p>Series contains images, chiefly engravings and lithographs, of various practices,
                  events, and themes related to the history of medicine. Arranged in alphabetical
                  order by subject, and by box number within. The series is arranged by original
                  topical groupings designated by library staff; new groups were also added for
                  additions to the collection. The current divisions are: <emph render="bold"
                     >Advertisements; Anatomy; Apothecary Jars; Baths; Bindings; Bloodletting; Books
                     and Illustrations; Buildings; Cardiology; Caricature; Cartoons; Cemeteries;
                     Chemistry; Childbirth; Circumcision; Embryology; History of Medicine;

                  series are Anatomy, Caricatures, Physicians, and Surgery.</p>
               <p>As with other series, the predominant formats are engravings and other printed
                  items (including postcards, posters, broadsides, and clippings), and 20th century
                  photographic images, often reproductions of printed works. Images are also often
                  accompanied by a slide or negative reproduction created by Medical Library staff
                  as far back as the 1960s. Sizes range from small prints under 10x12 inches, to
                  oversize items of up to 23x30 inches. The dimensions of oversize boxes are given
                  in the container inventory.</p>

                        images, taped onto two long pieces of hinged board, reproducing 17th century
                        anatomical figures standing before a rural landscape with towns. When put

                     <p>Four engravings by T. Cook from Hogarth's designs: "First stage of cruelty,"
                        "Second stage of cruelty," "Cruelty in perfection," and "The reward of

                        Around the central character in each engraving are shown many other acts of
                        cruelty by other individuals, with numerous symbolic elements.</p>
