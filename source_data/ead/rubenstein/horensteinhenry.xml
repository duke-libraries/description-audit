      <head>Content Description</head>
      <p>Collection comprises 153 black-and-white and color prints from portfolios by photographer
        Henry Horenstein, taken from 1970 to 2013 over the course of his long career. Subjects range
        widely, with some emphasis in the collection on images of entertainment and music culture:
        country and blues musicians, including Nathan Abshire, Loretta Lynn, Del McCoury, Dolly
        Parton, Stringbean, and Doc Watson, the venues where they perform, and their fans; street
        musicians, honky tonk bands and barroom dancers and drinkers; and drag and burlesque
        performers in Los Angeles, New York City, and Caracas and Buenos Aires, Venezuela.</p>
      <p>"Wesorts" refers to a project to document small, unique mixed-race communities in and near
        Marbury, Maryland; the term is said to have been coined from the phrase used by residents to
        refer to themselves, "we sorts of people." </p>
      <p>Other images include early portraits of Horenstein's family and friends; life on the El
        Malecón waterfront in Havana, Cuba; a highway in Louisiana; a historic theater in Branson,
        Missouri; close-up images of the human body; and behind the scenes in horse racing,
        including horses in action and at rest, grooms, owners, bettors, and jockeys, one of whom is
        Steve Cauthen. </p>
      <p>The prints come in sizes ranging from roughly 8x10 to 20x24 inches. Photographic formats
        include chromogenic, pigment inkjet (giclee), and gelatin silver darkroom prints; they are
        often marked with edition numbers, printing dates, and other information.</p>
      <p>With only a few exceptions, the images in this collection have been published by Horenstein
        in photobooks throughout his career. They have been exhibited widely and are held in the
        collections of museums, galleries, and other institutions.</p>

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>American-born photographer, documentary filmmaker, author, and teacher based in Boston,
        Henry Horenstein is noted for his portraiture and documentary projects on a wide variety of
        subjects. Horenstein studied history at the University of Chicago and received a BFA and MFA
        at Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), where he is currently professor of photography. He
        studied photography with Harry Callahan, Aaron Siskind, Minor White, and others. His work
        has been widely exhibited at the Smithsonian, J. Paul Getty Museum, High Museum of Art, San
        Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston,
        and published in photobooks, including <title render="italic">Close Relations</title>
        (2006); <title render="italic">Racing Days</title> (1987); <title render="italic"
          >Humans</title> (2004); <title render="italic">Honky Tonk: Portraits of Country
          Music</title> (2012); <title render="italic">Shoot What You Love</title> (2016); and
          <title render="italic">Show</title> (2010).</p>
      <p>From the artist's own statement about his work:</p>
      <p>"Over the years I've photographed many different types of subjects, even animals and the
        human form. But I've always returned to my roots as a documentary photographer. More than
        anything, I like a good story. And I try to tell one in a direct way, with humor and a punch
        line, if possible. With this in mind, I have photographed country musicians in Nashville, my
        family and friends in Massachusetts, horse racing at Saratoga, nightlife in Buenos Aires,
        old highways everywhere, everyone in Cajun Louisiana, South American baseball, camel
        breeding in Dubai, tri-racial families in Maryland, and much, much more."</p>
      <p>"For subjects, I prefer older cultures and places, especially disappearing ones. That's
        what my history teachers, Jesse Lemisch (at University of Chicago) and E.P. Thompson (at
        University of Warwick), taught me to do. These cultures and places might vanish, but it is a
        historian's righteous duty to make sure that they leave a trace. I also was very influenced
        by another teacher in Chicago, John G. Cawelti, who taught me (and doubting historians
        predating him) that popular culture should be taken seriously. One other great influence for
        me was my teacher at Rhode Island School of Design, Harry Callahan. Harry encouraged me to
        'shoot what you love,' and to pay no attention to what others are doing. 'Even if you make
        bad pictures,' he said, 'you'll have a good time.' Thank you for that, Harry."</p>

            and a few color portraits of Horenstein's friends, family members and their friends, a
            family poodle, and a few other various individuals. Most are interior shots taken in

            of a room with no people present. The images were almost all taken in Massachusetts,
            with the exception of one taken in North Carolina; two are in unknown locations. All

          <p>These 15 black-and-white photographs were shot by Henry Horenstein in winter of 2000 at
            a beach area called "The Malecón" in Havana, Cuba. They are almost all portraits of men
            and boys spending recreational time at this waterfront area. The prints measure
            approximately 8x12 inches and are in the original order as received from the
            photographer. They were all printed in 2019.</p>
          <p>Horenstein comments on this portfolio:</p>
          <p>"The Malecón is like a park for the people of Havana. Since it was the holidays [when I
            went], a lot of kids were out there during the day, swimming or boxing across the
            street. Families would come after work and have a picnic dinner. At around nine or ten
            in the evening, young people would come out to party and by one in the morning, it was a
            very sketchy crowd. I would occasionally be approached for 'extra activities.'...</p>
          <p>"I spent the whole time in the Malecón and really enjoyed myself. People were super
            friendly. No one had a problem being photographed. They could use a model fee, which was
            like 50 cents or a dollar. I chose to shoot in black and white because so many people
            were shooting the houses and cars of Cuba in colour then. I put the photographs away for
            a long time. I didn't want to be another invading photographer. I just wanted to make
            classic documentary-style photographs."</p>

          <p>These black-and-white photographs were taken as part of a long-term project by
            Horenstein to document traditional American music culture through images of performers
            and the local bars, music halls, theaters, and music festivals they frequent, as well as
            images of the music fans, lovers, drinkers, servers, and dancers who inhabit these
            venues. A few images of musicians were taken at their homes. Featured performers include
            Nathan Abshire, Waylon Jennings, Loretta Lynn, Del McCoury, Charlie Monroe, Dolly
            Parton, Hank Snow, Stringbean, Doc Watson, among others. Venues range from the
            Gettysburg, Pennsylvania Bluegrass Festival, to the Grand Ole Opry, to Tootsie's Orchid
            Lounge in Tennessee and the Take It Easy Ranch in Maryland. One image is of an
            unidentified elderly African American street musician in Houston, Texas.</p>
          <p>The images have been published in the photobook <title render="italic">Honky
              Tonk</title>; some also are featured in <title render="italic">Shoot What You
              Love</title>.</p>
          <p>Prints are arranged in chronological order and are sized approximately 16 x 20
            inches.</p>

          <p>These black-and-white images form part of a project documenting the culture and
            surroundings of horse racing in New York State, Maryland, and other localities. Visiting
            race tracks and associated buildings and interiors, Hornstein captures horses in action
            and at rest, jockeys, grooms, betters, and racing fans. Portraits of two notable jockeys
            appear: Steve Cauthen, and one of the few women jockeys, Joey Rusham. The images have
            been published in Horenstein's photobook <title render="italic">Racing Days</title>;
            several also appear in <title render="italic">Histories</title> and in <title
              render="italic">Shoot What You Love</title>. </p>
          <p>Prints are arranged in chronological order and are housed according to sheet sizes,
            ranging from approximately 8x10 to 20x24 inches.</p>

          <p>These 32 black-and-white photographs were taken from 1997 to 2003 by Henry Horestein as
            part of a project to document a cluster of unique communities in central Maryland in
            which the majority of inhabitants are of mixed race, frequently tri-racial. The name of
            the series and project comes from a phrase, "we sorts," used by locals to refer to
            themselves and to their community. </p>
          <p>Subjects include individual men and women, as well as family groups, at home, in yards,
            at a church and cemetery, and in a bar. One portrait takes in three generations of the
            Proctor family. Locations in Maryland include Bel Alton, Port Tobacco, and Hillcrest
            Heights. A few of the portraits are of former inhabitants of these small communities now
            living in Washington, D.C.</p>
          <p>The gelatin silver prints measure approximately 8x10 inches, and were printed in 1997,
            2003, and 2008.</p>
