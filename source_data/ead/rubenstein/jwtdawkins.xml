         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The papers of Colin Dawkins, a former Vice President of the J. Walter Thompson (JWT)
            advertising agency, span the years 1776 to 1986 with the bulk of the papers being dated
            between 1920 and 1981. The collection consists of Dawkins's research files, gathered for
            a proposed book on the history of the advertising business as it paralleled and was
            influenced by the growth and international development of JWT. These files contain
            correspondence, printed materials (including JWT newsletters), articles, clippings,
            speeches, writings, advertisements, reports, oral interview transcripts and cassette
            tapes. Clients represented in this collection include primarily the Ford Motor Company
            but also Kraft, Chesebrough-Ponds, Pan American, and Lever Brothers, and JWT executives
            represented include James Walter Thompson, Stanley Resor, Howard Kohl, Sam Meek, Helen
            Lansdowne Resor, Edward G. Wilson, Shirley Woodell, James Webb Young, and Dan Seymour.
            Much of the collection duplicates material found elsewhere in the extensive J. Walter
            Thompson Company Archives and many items are photocopies; however, the collection does
            contain unique material specifically in the Oral Interview Series and items thoughout
            the collection which Colin Dawkins collected.</p>
         <p>In October 1978, Dawkins began his advertising history project. During the next two
            years, he wrote to “JWT vets” requesting information about people and places, letters
            and memos, excerpts from speeches, artifacts, advertisements, pictures, and information
            on JWT offices.</p>
         <p>The Officers and Staff Series contains information by and about key personalities who
            contributed to the development of the J. Walter Thompson Company. The JWT employees
            represent the majority of the company's departments: broadcast, research, creative,
            international, publicity and public relations, and the executive administration.
            Especially well-documented individuals include Gelston Hardy, Kennett Hinks, Howard
            Kohl, Sam Meek, John Monsarrat, Helen Lansdowne Resor, Stanley Resor, Dan Seymour,
            Norman H. Strouse, James Walter Thompson, Edward G. Wilson, Shirley Woodell, and James
            Webb Young.</p>
         <p>The Clients Series consists of background information on a limited number of major and
            minor JWT clients, including Kraft, Pan American, Chesebrough-Ponds, Lever Brothers, and
            Ford Motor Company. Dawkins worked for many years on the Ford account, for which there
            is extensive information in this series. The Ford files document the 1957 “Around the
            World” campaign, international campaigns, background information on campaigns for
            Mustang and Maverick models, the history of JWT's relationship with Ford, presentations
            made to Ford, and Ford firsts in advertising.</p>
         <p>The Alphabetical Files Series is the largest series in the collection. The majority of
            information focuses on JWT through short company histories, the establishment and growth
            of departments (such as Broadcast and Radio), and both domestic and international
            offices, especially New York and London. The Alphabetical Files Series also documents
            JWT's innovations in the advertising business in the use of market research,
            testimonials, and women's perspective in advertising. The series contains some
            information about other advertising agencies in particular Batten, Barton, Durstine,
            Osborn; Lord &amp; Thomas; Foote, Cone &amp; Belding; and N. W. Ayer. Other topics in
            this series include general advertising history and economic comparisons of advertising
            agencies. Dawkins's research notes and correspondence files he kept for his advertising
            history project are in this series also.</p>
         <p>Dawkins travelled to visit key officers and staff members and recorded and transcribed
            their conversations. The cassettes and transcripts from these interviews are in the Oral
            Interview Series in both the Audio Subseries and the Transcripts Subseries. They provide
            personal insights into the history of the J. Walter Thompson Company.</p>
         <p>After three years of researching, Dawkins set out to write a history of advertising
            focussing on the J. Walter Thompson Company. The resulting text, entitled “Ain't It Hell
            On A Windy Day” was not published. The manuscript copy is in the Writings Series and is
            CLOSED except to the members of the J. Walter Thompson Company.</p>
         <p>The Advertisements Series is filed with the Oversize Material and contains the
            advertisements associated with specific Officers and Staff, Clients, and files in the
            Alphabetical Files. Also in this series are advertisements from Dawkins's Advertisement
            Portfolio.</p>
