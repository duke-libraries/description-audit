         <abstract id="aspace_bb50c9bdf5b87ef0ab04568d34a649c6">Educator, gay rights activist, and
            author of many works on sexuality, identity, and sex education, and the history of
            homosexuality and the gay rights movement in the United States. The James T. Sears
            Papers span the dates 1918-2011, with the bulk of the material covering the period
            between 1950 and 2004. The papers are arranged into the following series: Audiovisual
            Material; Other Activities; Personal Papers; Photographic Material; Professional Papers;
            the largest series, Research and Writings; Jack Nichols Papers; and Oversize Material.
            The Research and Writings series is divided into subseries for major works by Sears, as
            well as subseries for other writings and editorial work, research files, and a small set
            of writings by other individuals. Formats include but are not limited to correspondence,
            research files, writings, interviews, recordings, serials and newspapers, photographs,
            and diaries. The collection also houses the personal papers of Hal Call (1917-2000) and
            Jack Nichols (1938-2005), both early activists for gay rights. Taken as a whole, the
            collection offers a deep and rich source of information on gay, lesbian, and bisexual
            culture in the United States, especially in the South, and its representation in
            literature and in the press, both positive and negative; the history of the gay rights
            movement in the U.S. and abroad, including the evolution of organizations such as the
            Mattachine Society and related gay movement publications; sexuality studies in the U.S.
            and teaching sexuality in primary and secondary classrooms; gays in the military; drag
            queen, lesbian, and bisexual communities; and many other topics relevant to sexual
            identity in society.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The James T. Sears Papers span the dates 1918-2008, with the bulk of the material
            covering the period between 1950 and 2004, and are arranged in the following series:
            Audiovisual Material; Other Activities; Personal Papers; Photographic Material;
            Professional Papers; the largest series, Research and Writings; Jack Nichols Papers
            Series; and Oversize Material, which contains chiefly newspapers and other large-format
            serials. The Research and Writings series, the largest in the collection, is divided
            into subseries for each of Sears' major works; in addition, there are other large
            subseries for Sears' other writings and editorial work, research files, and a small set
            of writings by other individuals.</p>
         <p>The collection documents the career and life of a gay rights activist, educator, and
            author who has performed ground-breaking research on gay, lesbian, and bisexual culture
            in the United States, and the teaching of human sexuality in the classroom. The
            evolution and publication of Sears' major book-length works, articles, and other
            editorial work is fully documented in this collection in the form of drafts,
            correspondence, recorded and transcribed oral histories, many research files, and a wide
            variety of images and recordings. Sears' professional papers contain teaching and course
            materials as well as files on publicity, speeches, and other activities. Sears also
            worked as a journal and book editor, thus the collection houses various iterations of
            authors' accepted work along with Sears' line edits and final publications. Many
            electronic files accompanied the research, writing, and teaching files; these have been
            archived on the library's server. An extensive collection of audiovisual materials
            includes videos, sound recordings, and other media either assembled through Sears'
            research and teaching activities, or acquired from other sources (note: original
            recordings are closed to use; unless otherwise noted, listening or viewing copies must
            be made for research access). </p>
         <p>The collection also houses the personal papers of Hal Call (1917-2000) and Jack Nichols
            (1938-2005), authors and early activists for gay rights. These two large sub-collections
            contain writings, correspondence, research files, diaries, audiovisual material
            (separated and removed to the Audiovisual Series), and photographs. </p>
         <p>Taken as a whole, the James T. Sears Papers offer a rich source of primary documents and
            information on gay, lesbian, and bisexual culture in the United States, especially in
            the South, and its representation in literature and in the press, both positive and
            negative. The collection also provides extensive documentation on the history of the gay
            rights movement in the U.S. and abroad, including the evolution of organizations such as
            the Mattachine Society and related gay movement publications; sexuality studies in the
            U.S. and teaching sexuality in primary and secondary classrooms; gays in the military;
            drag queen, lesbian, and bisexual communities; and many other topics relevant to sexual
            identity in society. The collection also include anthropological field notes of Sears'
            extensive research and travels in the Philippines related to sexualities and sex
            education.</p>
         <p>Consent forms signed by individuals whose interviews or images were recorded for
            possible use in publications are sometimes filed with other records relevant to that
            publication; oftentimes, however, permissions may have been filed in the Research
            Permissions Subseries box in the Research and Writings Series, or have not been located
            in the collection. Researchers wishing to publish information on individuals represented
            in the Sears Papers must have in hand the consent forms, or obtain permission from the
            individuals.</p>

               <p>The research conducted by Sears over many decades spawned a large component of
                  audio and visual material, separated from the main collection either as originally
                  received or for preservation purposes, and described in this series. Materials are
                  found in a variety of formats, including audiocassettes, audiotapes,
                  microcassettes, small gauge films, and videocassettes. Subject matter can be
                  grouped into the following categories: interviews with Sears about his career;
                  publicity related to his writings; many oral histories and interviews of Jack
                  Nichols, Hal Call, and other activists and gays individuals interviewed by Sears;
                  histories of regional gay activism in Virginia, Kentucky, and other areas; audio
                  recordings from the earliest programs and conferences on homosexuality in the
                  U.S., some featuring Hal Call and Del Martin as speakers; recordings on aids,
                  cloning, and other issues; classroom and conference lectures by Sears; home movies
                  from James Sears and Jack Nichols; audio recordings belonging in the papers of
                  Jack Nichols; gay parades, rallies, and other social events, filmed by various
                  individuals; and other unidentified recordings.</p>
               <p>Arranged by format (audiocassettes, audiotapes, film, video, and other media), and
                  further subdivided into groupings that, when possible, parallel the series and
                  subseries in the rest of the collection. Format groupings are described in further
                  detail below. Items are arranged within categories mostly in original order as

                  <p>Videocassettes and some Hi-8 digital cassettes separated from other series in

                     own teaching materials and other series. Others were found loose. Many

                     broadcasts focused on gay history, gay rights, or sexuality and sex education;
                     Sears used many of these for his courses. Other recordings were collected by
                     Sears during research for his major written works. Some boxes include
                     manuscripts explaining video content or indexes to contents. For the most part,
                     titles are as originally given. Arranged in groups by series in main
                     collection; within, by date. Total running time (TRT) given where possible.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
               <p>Chiefly black-and-white photographic images used in Jim Sears' publications on gay
                  history, as well as a few publicity shots of Sears, and casual snapshots of Sears
                  at lectures, conferences, and book tours. Most of the research material was used
                  to illustrate <title type="simple" render="italic">Rebels, Rubyfruit and
                     Rhinestones</title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">Lonely
                     Hunters</title>. Files of materials considered for use in a publication are
                  identified with the original titles consisting of names of individuals, groups, or
                  locales; contents can include photographs, paper printouts of images, other
                  research material, clippings, permissions forms, and correspondence. </p>
               <p>Key communities represented in the research materials include Atlanta and New
                  Orleans, though there are files on most Southern states. The various materials in
                  the series cover the period from the late nineteenth century through the 1990s,
                  with the bulk focusing on the 20th century. While the majority of images relate to
                  urban issues, images of rural gay culture are also included; files on the Short
                  Mountain Sanctuary and people associated with it (among them Milo [Guthrie] Pyne
                  and Merril Mushroom) are notable in this regard. </p>
               <p>This series also includes a set of 21 signed 8x10 inch black-and-white portraits
                  of gay activists, writers, and artists by noted photographer Robert Giardi.
                  Giardi's subjects in alphabetical order: Paula Gunn Allen, Gloria Anzaldua, Perry
                  Brass, Forman Brown (pseudonym Richard Meeker), Allen Ginsburg, Essex Hemphill,
                  Dolores Kaich, Joan Larkin, Audre Lorde, Joan Nestle, Manuel Ramos Otero, Pat
                  Parker, Felice Picano-Amagansett, Venita Porter, John Preston, James Purdy,
                  Assotto Saint, Barbara Smith, Kitty Tsui, Carolyn Weather, and Jenny Wrenn; there
                  is also a group portrait of the managing editors of <title type="simple"
                     render="italic">RFD</title> (publication of the Radical Faeries) at Short
                  Mountain Sanctuary, an intentional gay community in rural Tennessee. The series is
                  arranged alphabetically. </p>
               <p>Other photographs and images can also be found throughout the James Sears Papers;
                  additionally, hundreds of digital images related to this series and to other
                  materials in the collection have been separated and mounted on a library server;
                  please contact Research Services for access to these images.</p>

                     reviews of Sears' work, primarily in the gay press, are also included.
                     Correspondence in this series pertains to efforts by Sears and his publicists
                     to secure speaking or reading engagements at bookstores and other venues in
                     1997 and 2001. Although a few items relating to Sears' published work on
                     curriculum are included, his conference papers on that topic are located in the
                     Conferences and Organizations Subseries above and his academic lectures in the
                     Teaching Subseries below. Arranged in chronological order.</p>

                     <p>Also referred to in earlier material as "Generations," this volume was
                        published as the first in a series on history of homosexuality and gay
                        movements in the U.S. Contains groups of drafts and proofs, publicity, and
                        research files. Drafts and proofs are arranged in the order in which they
                        were received. Several files of proofs or drafts include the 1995
                        prospectus, correspondence with Sears' colleagues and proofreaders,
                        including Kepner's foreword, an interview with Barbara Gittings (Daughters
                        of Bilitis founder) for the afterword, Gordon Hall (Dawn Langley Simmons),
                        and Jack Nichols. Publicity files are arranged alphabetically, and include
                        book reviews, awards, book tour schedules, promotional statements, and a
                        video. Research files, arranged alphabetically, include chapter and
                        interview notes, early research materials about gender, early homosexuality
                        cases, and gay identity, as well as correspondence and research materials
                        relating to book subjects Jack Nichols, Dawn Langley Simmons, and Sue
                        Sponnoble. The last three boxes of research files pertain to an inquiry into
                        homosexuality at the University of Florida in the late fifties; they contain
                        depositions, statements, and court documents pertaining to the Johns
                        Committee proceedings; these documents are arranged in order as
                        received.</p>

                        internal arrangement are further described below. The largest group, the
                        research files (36 boxes), documents Sears' work on the book through
                        correspondence, clippings and articles files, interviews, memoirs, oral
                        histories, regional material from southern states, files on activist groups,
                        memorabilia, and other material. The research files also house a set of
                        diaries written by a gay youth from 1973-1993, and a large component of
                        materials, chiefly correspondence, written by Jack Nichols and Lige Clarke.
                        Other material on Nichols can be found in the Jack Nichols Papers
                        Series.</p>

                           conventions and various financial and legal activities of the Mattachine

                           folders. The alphabetical folders reflect a broad range of topics,
                           including all of the following: balance sheets and other budget
                           activities; chapters of the Society in various cities; FBI files; related
                           groups such as One, Inc. and Pan-Graphic Press; and the work of various
                           committees, especially the Publications Committee. The chronological run
                           of folders consists almost entirely of minutes, agendas, and related
                           documents from meetings and conventions. This group of folders contains a
                           mix of documents that were produced by individual chapters as well as
                           national conventions of the Society, w/some individual folders containing
                           items from multiple sources; all are interfiled chronologically.</p>

                           about the early history of the Mattachine in San Francisco; some material

                           folder contents vary: most contain multiple drafts of a single chapter,
                           but others contain a single draft of multiple chapters.</p>

                        <p>Contains transcripts of interviews with over forty individuals that Sears
                           conducted or gathered as part of his research for <title type="simple"
                              render="italic">Behind the Mask of the Mattachine</title>. Interviews
                           conducted by Sears took place in the late 1990s and early 2000s, while
                           those by other researchers took place as much as thirty years earlier up
                           through the 1990s; other interviewers include Paul Cain, Martin Meeker,
                           and Frank Prager. For most transcripts there are release forms signed by
                           the interviewees; these are usually filed at the front of the folder
                           containing the transcripts, but others were also left as received, in a
                           separate folder at the beginning of the folder group. In addition to
                           transcripts and release forms, folders also contain associated
                           correspondence and e-mail between Sears, other researchers, and the
                           interviewees; printed material; research notes; and a few photographs.
                           Some folders contain only these supporting materials and no transcripts;
                           they often appear to be preparatory work for interviews that did not take
                           place. Interviews are mainly concerned with the Mattachine Society in San
                           Francisco in the 1950s-1970s, but also cover chapters in other cities.
                           Interviewees prominently cited in the book include: Martin Block, Ken
                           Burns, Frank Kameny, Jim Kepner, Hal Lawson, Dorr Legg, Don Lucas,
                           Phyllis Lyon, Del Martin, Jack Nichols, and Randy Wicker. Transcripts for
                           several interviews with Hal Call are all housed in the Hal Call folder
                           group in this subseries. Arranged alphabetically.</p>

                     <p>Edited by Sears with assistance from James C. Carper. Originated from
                        controversy surrounding Sears' course on Christian fundamentalism and
                        education (see other materials on this topic in the Teaching Series).
                        Arranged in four groupings: Correspondence, Dialogues, Editorial Files, and
                        Publicity. Correspondence includes letters written between Sears and chapter
                        authors, and Sears and his publishers at Teachers College Press. Dialogues
                        contain several printed round table discussions pertaining to chapters in
                        this publication. Editorial files also contain correspondence with chapter
                        authors and Teachers College Press, as well as chapters written by a select
                        group of contributors. All files arranged alphabetically.</p>

                        consists of exchanges between some of the authors (Louise Allen, James
                        Sears, J. Dan Marshall, Patrick Roberts, and William A. Schubert) and the
                        publishers. Loose drafts and publisher revisions are often included with
                        this correspondence. The Drafts and Proofs grouping houses copy edits,
                        drafts, layouts, and manuscripts.</p>

                  <p>Materials covering a wide variety of research topics of interest to Sears,
                     including homosexuality in the United States before 1950, the history of gays
                     in the military, a study on new generations of gays, and international gay
                     movements. Other boxes contain general research materials on gays in the South
                     which informed multiple works by Sears. The individual states of Alabama and
                     Florida have their own boxes of research materials, while materials from
                     Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and
                     Washington D.C. are housed as a group. Formats in the Research Files Subseries
                     are varied, and can include print materials such as clippings, flyers,
                     newsletters, and serial issues; field notes and other research materials;
                     correspondence; photographs and other types of illustrations; and recorded oral
                     histories and interviews. In addition to correspondence and materials deriving
                     from Sears' research, there are significant amounts of primary materials from
                     original sources, especially correspondence and a few diaries. More detailed

                        in New York and New Jersey. It was probably written in the 1980s or 1990s. </p>
                     <p>The Hayes materials offer a detailed look into the life of a gay man growing
                        up in rural North Carolina who "came out" in college and became part of the
                        early gay community in Charleston, South Carolina during the 1940s.
                        Materials include a diary kept in Jerry Hayes' teen years (typed
                        transcription), a brief memoir by Hayes, interviews conducted in 1999, and
                        paper prints of digitized photographs that date from circa 1920-1940. </p>
                     <p>The Schwartz materials cover the life events of a gay man from Birmingham,
                        Alabama, who also became a Charleston resident; the bulk of this material
                        consists of photocopies of hundreds of pieces of correspondence, numbered
                        and arranged in chronological order, from Schwartz to family members and
                        friends during his military service, 1936-1946. Includes interviews on
                        cassettes conducted in 1998. A few folders contain early printed matter from
                        1957-1966, including a pamphlet on the psychology of homosexuality, and a
                        "gay girl's guide." </p>
                     <p>Finally, another set of files corresponds to research Sears conducted on
                        early criminal cases linked with homosexual behavior, and personal histories
                        of lesbians in the Northeast during the early 20th centuries (Laura Beam,
                        Harriet Hosmer, Ellen Day Hale), and contain resource listings from the
                        Schlesinger Library at Harvard and some photocopied primary material from
                        several archival institutions, including Duke University.</p>

                        1970s and 1980s. Printed materials include clippings, newspapers, flyers,

                        communities in Florida. One set of files follows the case of Pedro Zamora,

                        coverage of his life and death; another set of research materials documents
                        the "Enloe Six" case in N.C., and includes original correspondence with one
                        of the young men involved in the case. Material has not been published.
                        Finally, there are three videos: one covering the memorial service for

               <p>Collection of writings, ephemera, clippings, and other materials assembled by Jack
                  Nichols, close friend of James Sears. The two met in the 1970s while Sears was
                  researching the first volume in his series on gay history. Nichols, a journalist,
                  writer, and gay activist from the sixties, became one of Sears' primary
                  contributors to <title type="simple" render="italic">Lonely Hunters</title> and to
                  subsequent historical works by Sears, most notably <title type="simple"
                     render="italic">Rebels, Rubyfruit, and Rhinestones</title>. When Nichols died

                  <p>Comprised almost entirely of newspaper and magazine clippings highlighting
                     Nichols' work as a social activist and writer as well as various movements of
                     interest to him. Included in this series are clippings of coverage of gay
                     rights demonstrations, often related to government responses to the AIDS
                     crisis. Several books of clippings (one with photographs) document Nichols'
                     activities as a gay rights organizer in the cities of Washington, New York, and
                     Cocoa Beach, Florida. In addition, clippings and printed materials related to
                     "men's liberation" and related critiques of traditional gender roles can be
                     found in this series. Copies of some writings by Nichols, notably the
                     serialized <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Calamus Chronicles</title>
                     (originally <title type="simple" render="doublequote">The Tomcat

                     written for Florida newspapers are housed in this series. Organized

                  <p>Consists of personal and business correspondence spanning the entirety of
                     Nichols' adult life, with the bulk of the material dated between 1969 and 2000.
                     Correspondence with other major figures in the early gay rights movement,
                     including fellow Washington D.C. Mattachine Society founder Frank Kameny and
                     Barbara Gittings, are included. While the political climate and need for action
                     are often discussed in letters in this series, correspondence also covers
                     topics of a more personal nature, including health, jobs, and Nichols' efforts
                     to publish his literary work. Letters to and from friends and lovers,
                     particularly Clarke and Logan Carter, are included as well. Additional major
                     correspondents with Nichols include his mother Mary Finlayson Lund, Leo Skir,
                     Bob Kunst, and James T. Sears. Early correspondence chronicles the work of
                     Nichols and Lige Clarke as editors of the national newspaper <title
                        type="simple" render="italic">Gay</title>; later material documents Nichols'
                     struggles to find agents and publishers for various manuscripts. Nichols' work
                     as editor of the online publication <title type="simple" render="italic">Gay
                        Today</title> can be found in the writing and business correspondence
                     grouping. Also included are a grouping of address and appointment books kept by
                     Nichols. Series is predominantly organized by year, though groups of letters
                     separated by Nichols are organized alphabetically by correspondent.</p>

                  <p>Includes files and ephemera from Nichols' childhood through late in his life.
                     Diplomas, grades, and a certificate of baptism document elements of his early
                     life. Course evaluations from a philosophy class in which his book <title

                     some of the reactions the public had to Nichols' work. Press material and
                     clippings as well as book publishing contracts document the some of the
                     business aspects of his professional life. Personal, medical, and financial
                     papers complete the series. Organized alphabetically.</p>

                  <p>Contains files kept by Nichols on a variety of topics, chiefly social issues.
                     Folders of material related to close friend and lover Lige Clarke make up the
                     largest grouping. These include some of Clarke's early school and personal
                     papers as well as correspondence and information related to his violent death
                     during a robbery in Mexico. Documentation of the lives and early deaths of
                     activists Foster Gunnison and David Combs are included along with a file on the
                     suspicious death of New York transvestite Marsha P. Johnson. Nichols' interest
                     in anarchist philosophy and action is documented in the Anarchism grouping, and
                     some information about the New Age group Renewal is housed in this subseries as
                     well. Research material related to writings on Logan Carter and men's
                     liberation complete the series. Organized alphabetically by subject.</p>
