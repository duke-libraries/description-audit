         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p> The Ben Rosen Papers span the years 1936 to 2006, with the bulk of the collection
            dating from 1945 through 1991, and document Rosen's sixty-year career in graphic design
            and visual communications consulting. The collection contains materials in a variety of
            formats, including correspondence, writings, graphic design and printed materials,
            sketches, presentation boards, photographs, and slides, that document design concepts
            and programs (corporate logos, letterhead, packaging, industrial design, promotion).
            Rosen developed corporate visual identity programs and packaging designs, first as an
            employee of J. Gordon Carr and Associates and the Blaine Thompson Company, and later
            through his own firm, Ben Rosen Associates, for clients including American Loose Leaf,
            CCMI McGraw-Hill, Equitable Life Assurance, Exxon/Esso, Food Fair Stores, IBM, Memorial
            Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, North American Reinsurance, Philip Morris,
            Richardson-Vicks, Russ Berrie, and Tishman Realty and Construction. The collection also
            includes manuscripts and published editions of Rosen's books on graphic design and
            typography: <title type="simple" render="italic">Type and Typography</title> (1963);
               <title type="simple" render="italic">The Corporate Search for Visual Identity</title>
            (1970); and <title type="simple" render="italic">Digital Type Specimens</title> (1991);
            and touches on several of Rosen's commmemorative projects, including a memorial for
            President John F. Kennedy, a United Nations 20th Anniversary book, and Rosen's
            submission to the World Trade Center Memorial design competition. </p>
         <p>The collection is organized into five series: <emph render="bold">Personal Files</emph>,
               <emph render="bold">Writings</emph>, <emph render="bold">Business Files</emph>, <emph
               render="bold">Client Files</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Photographic
               Materials</emph>. The <emph render="bold">Personal Files Series</emph> includes
            original student drawings and sketches from Rosen's years at Cranbrook and Pratt, and
            later artwork; World War II materials, primarily relating to Rosen's proposed plan to
            the British government for the conversion of U.S. military bases into postwar British
            housing; and limited biographical material. The <emph render="bold">Writings
               Series</emph> contains articles on package design and visual communications by Rosen

         <p>Corporate visual identity encompasses a wide range of media and materials, from logos
            and letterhead designs to employee manuals, product packaging, architectural signage and
            company vehicle markings, and thus pose particular challenges for archival housing and
            description. Housing needs to accommodate the variety of formats have forced some
            related materials within the collection to be dispersed across a number of physical and
            descriptive locations. Where feasible, materials removed from their original locations
            in the collection have been indicated by a folder or item title appearing in brackets
            within the finding aid, to preserve the logical location of the item while pointing to
            its new physical location.</p>

               <p>Contains design concepts, sketches, presentation materials/display boards, and
                  final designs for a variety of visual communications projects, with a focus on
                  corporate identity programs and package design. Bulk of series represents package
                  design sketches, mock-ups, and finished products produced for clients including
                  American Loose Leaf, CCMI/McGraw-Hill, Equitable Life Assurance, Exxon, Gilbarco

                  Realty and Construction. Materials also touch on Rosen's work on projects for
                  government and public institutions, including a President Kennedy memorial
                  document, a commemorative book for the United Nations 20th anniversary, and

               <head>Processing Information.</head>
               <p>Corporate visual identity encompasses a wide range of media and materials, from
                  logos and letterhead designs to employee manuals, product packaging, architectural
                  signage and company vehicle markings, and thus pose particular challenges for
                  archival housing and description. The series is thus organized into three
                  format-based categories: <emph render="bold">Corporate Identity Programs and Paper
                     Records</emph>; <emph render="bold">Package Designs and Layout Models</emph>;
                  and <emph render="bold">Presentations, Sketches and Architectural Models</emph>.
                  Housing needs have caused materials for individual clients to be dispersed across
                  the categories; likewise, within each category, housing issues have required
                  further arrangements into small- and large-format items. Where large format
                  materials have been removed from their original locations in the collection, a
                  dummy folder, indicated by a title in brackets, has been inserted to indicate
                  removal of the item. Thereunder, items are arranged alphabetically.</p>
