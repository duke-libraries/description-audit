      <p>The Louis H. (Louis Harry) Roddis Papers were donated to the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book
        &amp; Manuscript Library by Louis H. and Alice Roddis in 1982, 1984, 1991, and 1992.
        Processing of this collection was supported in part by gifts from Louis H. Roddis.</p>

      <p>Much of the collection is in the order that Roddis arranged and indexed it. His index forms
        the appendix. Some materials that are more appropriate for the general library have been
        removed for possible inclusion. Series that Roddis did not index are arranged primarily the
        way the materials were sent to the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library.
        Note that a portion of the Three Mile Island Series is found towards the end of the
        collection in boxes 98-100.</p>

          <p>Materials include ERAB reports, articles, correspondence, memoranda, agenda,
            transcripts of proceedings, meeting minutes, Roddis's notes, maps, photographs, trip
            iteneraries, clippings, charts, and newsletters. Roddis was a board member of the Energy
            Research Advisory Board (ERAB) which is a division of the Department of Energy (DOE).
            ERAB studies and analyzes various energy concerns and advises the DOE on such matters.
            Roddis generated these materials during his tenure with ERAB, therefore, the materials
            primarily pertain to meetings, ERAB's processes, organization, amd member lists, studies
            performed by various panels, conferences, investigations, and dealings with the DOE.
            Topics concern a range of energy issues including nuclear weapons, petroleum reserves
            and regulatory activities, magnetic fusion, space propulsion, waste disposal,
            transportation, coal, effective uses of energy, economic policy evaluatin, policy and
            fiscal guidance for energy projections, acid rain, importance of research, environmental
            effects, solar energy, and energy safety. Correspondents include executives from US and
            international utility companies, federal government officials from DOE and the
            Departmaent of the Interior, and members of ERAB. Arranged by Roddis's index codes.</p>

          <p>The Chernobyl Series contains materials on the nuclear plant accident of April 26,
              <unitdate era="ce" calendar="gregorian" type="inclusive"> 1986. </unitdate> Reported
            to be the worst nuclear disaster in history, the plant in the USSR exploded thereby
            releasing radiation into the air. This accident caused the United States to take an
            indepth look at its own nuclear facilities. Roddis collected information on this
            incident and headed a group that investigated the "N"(Nuclear)-Reactor in Hartford,
            Washington (same type of plant as in Chernobyl) to see if it was safe. Consists of
            correspondence, Department of Energy (DOE) memorandums, transcripts of congressional
            hearings, articles, press releases, reports, photographs, clippings, and briefings on
            the accident at Chernobyl. Also contains reports, articles, correspondence, and notes
            from meetings concerning general nuclear safety, public fears of nuclear power, nuclear
            reactors design, the nature of hydrogen in nuclear plants, nuclear safety in Russia, and
            effects of the incident on Russia's economy. Two reports found in this series include
            the <title type="simple" render="doublequote">The Accident of Chernobyl and its
              Consequences</title> by the USSR State Committee on Utilization of Atomic Energy and
              <title type="simple" render="doublequote">'N'-Reactor Updated Safety Analysis
              Report</title> compiled by Roddis's research group. See also AIF series.</p>

          <p>The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) is a federally controlled company that
            runs the production of electric power in Puerto Rico. Roddis worked in connection with
            the Blue Ribbon Panel which evaluated the activities of PREPA. This series provides
            insight to the creation, purpose, and activities of PREPA. Contains committee meeting
            minutes, correspondence, photographs, schedules, notes, and reports on PREPA including a
            report from the Blue Ribbon Panel evaluating PREPA and PREPA's response to the report.
            Topics include recommendations for better efficiency and lower costs, and look at the
            feasibility of producing Puerto Rico's energy from coal.</p>

          <p>Includes legal papers in the form of exhibits, cross-examinations, rebuttals, and
            testimonies, LILCO Board meeting minutes and annual reports, articles, clippings,
            reports, and an executive summary. LILCO is a utility company that faced bankruptcy in
            the mid <unitdate era="ce" calendar="gregorian" type="inclusive"> 1980s </unitdate>due
            to its nuclear venture, the 4.1 billion dollar Shoreham facility. The State of New York
            Public Service Commission ordered an investigation, which lasted over fifteen years, of
            the Shoreham Nuclear Power Project. Issues discussed deal with the financial troubles of
            the Shoreham facility particularly and the company as a whole. Testimonies are from
            LILCO executives, qualitity assurances personnel, project management, engineering
            management, and construction management. Proceedings concerned LILCO's management
            decisions including associated construction methods, cost increases, and project
            controls. Some information on the Detroit Consolidated Edison Company's dealings with
            the State of Michigan's Public Service Commission in order to ammend rates and
            Trans-Alaska Pipeline System issues are found in this series.</p>

          <p>Contains correspondence, memoranda, reports, notes, meeting packets, clippings, and
            articles. The WPPSS is a Pacific Northwest utilities company. The primary issue
            discussed is the company's financial troubles, especially of the company's nuclear
            reactor the Washington Nuclear Plant-2. The series represents the methodical audit of
            the entire design and construction processes conducted by in-house teams. Their purpose
            was to provide WPPSS and others with the best assurance attainable that the design
            fulfills all that is required of it and that what was designed has been faithfully
            preserved in construction. Roddis worked on the independent review team which served to
            evaluate and criticize the procedures, scope, and conduct of the in-house effort, point
            out inadequacies, recommend improvements and express confidence in results.</p>

            Research Institute (GRI) and Institute of Gas Technology (IGT), both of which dedicate
            their efforts to discovering innovations in efficiency and safety with natural gas. The
            focus of this series is the GRI and IGT research of efficient uses of gas in order to
            repeal the Power Plant and Industrial Fuel Act which required utilities to go back to
            predominantly using coal so as not to deplete the supply of gas and petroleum.</p>
