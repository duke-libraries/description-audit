      <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>John Hope Franklin was born on January 2, 1915, in Rentiesville, Oklahoma. He was the
        youngest of four children born to Buck Colbert Franklin, an attorney, and Mollie Parker
        Franklin, a teacher. In 1925, the family moved to Tulsa. Franklin graduated from Booker T.
        Washington High School in 1931, at age sixteen. He attended Nashville's Fisk University,
        where he received his B.A. in History in 1935. With the financial help of his undergraduate
        mentor, Professor Theodore S. Currier, Franklin continued his education at Harvard
        University, becoming the first African American graduate student in the Department of
        History. He received his M.A. in 1936 and completed his Ph.D. in 1941. During that time,
        Franklin taught briefly at Fisk University before accepting a position at St. Augustine's
        College in Raleigh, NC in 1939. In 1940, Franklin married his wife of fifty-nine years,
        Aurelia Whittington Franklin. The two had met as classmates at Fisk. Their son, John
        Whittington Franklin, was born in 1952.</p>
      <p>In 1943, Franklin published his first book, The Free Negro in North Carolina, 1790-1860,
        and joined the History Department at the North Carolina College for Negroes in Durham (now
        North Carolina Central University). During his tenure there, he began research for From
        Slavery to Freedom: A History of American Negroes, a seminal text on African American
        history. The book was first published in 1947 and has remained in print since. That same
        year, Franklin received an appointment at Howard University in Washington, DC. It was in
        Washington that Franklin met prominent white historian, C. Vann Woodward. Soon after, the
        two integrated the 1949 meeting of the Southern Historical Association. While at Howard,
        Franklin joined other prominent historians and assisted the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund
        school desegregation case, Brown vs. Board of Education. </p>
      <p>In 1956, Brooklyn College, a predominantly white institution, appointed Franklin as
        Chairman of the Department of History. Franklin made headlines as the first African American
        appointed chair in any department at a traditionally white institution. In the course of his
        tenure in Brooklyn, where he served until 1965, Franklin published three books: The Militant
        South, 1800-1860 (1956), Reconstruction after the Civil War (1961), and The Emancipation
        Proclamation (1963). He spent the 1963 school year as the Pitt Professor of American History
        at St. Johns College in Cambridge University.</p>
      <p>In 1964, Franklin joined the faculty at the University of Chicago. He was the Chairman of
        the History Department from 1967 to 1970 and the John Matthews Manly Distinguished Service
        Professor from 1969 to 1982. While at the University of Chicago, Franklin served as the
        President of the Southern Historical Society, the Organization of American Historians, and
        the American Historical Association. In addition to leading prestigious scholarly
        organizations, Franklin also served on the National Council on the Humanities from 1976 to
        1982, and published Color and Race (1969) and Racial Equality in America (1979). He became
        Professor Emeritus at UC in 1982. </p>
      <p>Franklin and his wife Aurelia retired to North Carolina in 1981 where he served for one
        year as a fellow with the National Humanities Center in Research Triangle Park. In 1982, he
        joined Duke University's faculty as the James B. Duke Professor of History. He was the first
        African American to hold an endowed chair at Duke. Upon reaching the mandatory retirement
        age in 1985, he retired for a second time to Professor Emeritus in a History Department and
        became Professor of Legal History at Duke, a position he held until 1992. During that time,
        he published George Washington Williams: A Biography (1985) and Race and History, Selected
        Essays (1989).</p>
      <p>During the 1990s, Franklin received numerous awards and honorary degrees in recognition of
        his groundbreaking scholarship, academic service, and dedication to teaching. In 1995,
        President William Clinton awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Clinton also
        appointed Franklin to chair the Advisory Board on the President's Initiative on Race from
        1997 to 1998.</p>
      <p>Well into his late 70s and 80s, Franklin continued his research and writing with The Color
        Line: Legacy for the Twenty-First Century (1993) and My Life and an Era: The Autobiography
        of Buck Colbert Franklin, which he edited with his son, John Whittington Franklin. Franklin
        published two more scholarly works with historian Loren Scwheninger, Runaway Slaves: Rebels
        on the Plantation (1999) and In Search of the Promised Land: a Slave Family in the Old South
        (2005). His last book was his own autobiography, Mirror to America: the Autobiography of
        John Hope Franklin, published in 2005. </p>
      <p>Franklin died on March 25, 2009, in Durham, North Carolina. He was 94 years old.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The John Hope Franklin papers document the whole of Franklin's professional career as a
        historian, as well as his personal life, early student years, and political interests.
        Collection materials include correspondence, research materials assembled by Franklin,
        writings by and about Franklin, drafts of writings, materials relating to family history,
        printed material, notebooks, information and multimedia packets, clippings, photographs,
        video and sound recordings, as well as a few artifacts. The collection was acquired as part
        of the John Hope Franklin Center for African and African American History and Culture.</p>
      <p>The Academics series chronicles Franklin's career as a professor of history. It includes
        materials documenting his role as a mentor and advisor to numerous undergraduate and
        graduate students, his lecture notes and other classroom materials, and his administrative
        and committee work at various institutions, including Brooklyn College, University of
        Chicago, and Duke University. Portions of this series are restricted.</p>
      <p>The series on the Advisory Board for the President's Initiative on Race contains items
        Franklin gathered during his work on President Clinton's race initiative, "One America in
        the 21st Century." The bulk of the series dates from the year-long work of the Advisory
        Board, from 1997 to 1998, and primarily comprises items sent to the Board for consideration
        in its work, meeting materials, publicity, and scholarly materials.</p>
      <p>The videos and sound recordings in the Audiovisual series were created or assembled by John

        Series are closed to use. Use copies are available for some items. Please contact Research
        Services staff in advance before coming to use this series.</p>

        personal and professional correspondence received and sent by Franklin throughout his adult
        life. </p>
      <p>The Engagements series includes invitations, correspondence, programs, and itineraries
        related to Franklin's participation in scholarly, civic, and social events. These materials
        have been arranged chronologically. </p>
      <p>Franklin's Honors and Awards series includes certificates and diplomas, as well as
        logistical and administrative documentation for many of the awards ceremonies. The series is
        divided into Honorary Degrees and General Awards, both sorted in chronological order.</p>
      <p>The Personal and Family Materials series contains the earliest items in the collection,
        with materials from Franklin's parents and grandparents. It includes files documenting
        Franklin's life and interests outside of his scholarship and public service. Materials are
        arranged by family member, with Franklin's wife, Aurelia, and his father, Buck Colbert
        Franklin, heavily represented. Also contains papers related to Theodore Currier, Franklin's
        mentor; John Hope eventually served as an executor of his estate.</p>
      <p>The Research, Biographical, and Subject Files series contains newspaper clippings, subject
        files, travel guides, and photocopies of Franklin's FBI file. Also contains publicity and
        newspaper coverage of Franklin's many interviews and public appearances throughout the
        twentieth century. </p>
      <p>The large Service series includes files acquired through Franklin's government,
        professional, and community service with various organizations and projects. Materials range
        from the early 1950s through the 2000s and are arranged alphabetically by organization or
        project name. </p>
      <p>Franklin's prolific writing career is documented in the Writings series, which includes
        materials on his many books, articles, speeches, book reviews, essays, interviews, and other
        works, many unpublished. A portion of this series is restricted; please contact the
        Rubenstein Library for more information.</p>
      <p>The Writings by Others series documents the ongoing relationship Franklin had with other
        authors and historians. It includes correspondence, drafts, and printed materials. Files are
        arranged alphabetically by author.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Courtland Cox papers is a series of manuscripts belonging to Cox, a civil
        rights activist, collected by Franklin as supporting materials for a research project. The
        Rubenstein Library also holds a separate collection of Cox papers chiefly relating to his
        work with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).</p>

          <p>The Academia series contains three subseries: Student Files, Lecture Notes, and
            Colleges and Universities. Student Files have been arranged alphabetically by student
            name. Lecture Notes are arranged alphabetically by title. Colleges and Universities have
            been sorted by college, reflecting Franklin's long career as an educator at institutions

          <p>This series chronicles Franklin's work as a professor of history. It includes materials
            documenting his role as a mentor and advisor to numerous undergraduate and graduate
            students, his lecture notes and other classroom materials, and his administrative and
            committee work at various institutions. Student Files make up a significant portion of
            the series. Franklin kept files on particular students, arranged by name, from Brooklyn
            College or the University of Chicago. Teaching Materials consists largely of general
            lecture notes from various courses Franklin taught through his career. The Colleges and
            Universities subseries has been arranged by school, with the majority of files stemming
            from Franklin's work at Brooklyn College, University of Cambridge, University of
            Chicago, and Duke University. This subseries includes materials relating to Franklin's
            appointments and employment as well as department and university-level correspondence,
            events, and committees.</p>

            <p>Name files maintained by Franklin for select students (usually PhD students) at
              Brooklyn College and the University of Chicago. Typical files include dissertation
              abstracts, Franklin's evaluations of their work (not including grades), correspondence
              and letters of recommendation, and published articles or other clippings. These files
              often extend far beyond the dates of the students' enrollment in Franklin's
              departments, reflecting his continuing role as a mentor and colleague to many of his
              former PhD students. The Student Files subseries includes notable figures such as
              Genna Rae McNeil, Alfred Moss, and Loren Schweninger, each of whom went on to
              collaborate with Franklin on some of his later publications.</p>

              North Carolina College, and Howard University, as well as files from several of
              Franklin's short-term visiting professorships. Materials from Duke University fall
              under Duke University Archives restrictions. Gradebooks from Franklin's early days of
              teaching and his card files of students at the University of Chicago are held in Box

          <p>Contains items Franklin gathered during his work on President Clinton's race
            initiative, "One America in the 21st Century." The material dates from 1972 to 2008,
            although the bulk of the series dates from the year-long work of the Advisory Board,
            from 1997 to 1998. It is arranged into five subseries: Meeting Notebooks, Writings for
            Board Consideration, Writings About the Advisory Board, Artifacts, and Audiovisual
            Materials (removed to the Audiovisual Series for preservation purposes). The series is
            primarily comprised of items sent to the Board for consideration in its work (including
            books, reports, articles, serials, working papers, information packets, booklets,
            multimedia packets, artifacts, audio-and videocassettes). There are also Advisory Board
            meeting notebooks, preparatory materials, and correspondence, as well as writings about
            Board activities from their website and newspapers across the United States. The series
            is strong on materials regarding scholarly input into the deliberations of the Board.
            The final report by the Advisory Board, "One America in the 21st Century," is included
            in the Writings About the Advisory Board subseries, and is also available in Duke
            Libraries' general holdings.</p>

            <p>The Recordings of Franklin subseries documents a wide range of Franklin's activities
              from interviews, to appearances in historic or racially themed documentaries and
              educational videos, to lectures and speeches on race, race relations in the U.S., and
              the historian's role in interpreting history. One set of tapes record a lengthy oral
              history interview of Franklin by A. Ballard, National Humanities Center, in which
              Franklin recounts events in his life from his earliest years in Oklahoma to his
              decision to go to the University of Chicago. Another audiocassette includes an
              interview of T.S. Currier with Franklin.</p>

            <p>The Recordings of Others subseries contains a variety of items. Some stem from
              organizations Franklin was connected with, such as the Children's Defense Fund and the
              USSAS in Durban. Other recordings concern topics related to Franklin's work, including
              commercial videos on race-related issues. A smaller number of recordings include
              commercial musical performances, including a compilation of Civil War songs performed
              by a former student of Franklin, to recordings of notable writers and historians. The
              earliest musical recordings is from 1959, "An Evening of Spirituals" performed by
              African American artist Merritt Hedgeman.</p>

            Recommendations, Declined Invitations, Advice to Authors, and Offers.</p>

            Series. The Student Files subseries in the Academia Series also includes many
            recommendation letters.</p>

            <p>Notable or significant correspondence with Franklin's professional contacts has been
              separated from General Correspondence into the Professional Correspondence Name Files.
              These files document Franklin's ongoing relationships with particular scholars and
              organizations. </p>
            <p>Among the earliest correspondence are letters to and from Will H. Alexander, Herbert
              Aptheker, Howard K. Beale, Paul H. Buck, W.E.B. Dubois, Franklin E. Frazier, Oscar
              Handlin, Harold Hyman, Charles S. Johnson, Mordecai Johnson, Alain Locke, James
              Shephard, and other academics who encouraged and supported Franklin in his earliest
              research, and foundations offering scholarships to promising graduate students. There
              are also single letters from Martin Luther King, Jr., Pauli Murray, and Rosa
              Parks.</p>
            <p>Additional professional correspondence can be found throughout other series,
              concentrated particularly in the Academia, Service, and Engagements series.</p>

          <p>These materials have been arranged chronologically. All engagements have been grouped
            by year and month, and those engagements which included a significant amount of
            accompanying materials have been foldered individually by event. Oversize engagement
            materials dated 1960s-2000s have been removed to Box OV1.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>This series includes materials related to Franklin's participation in scholarly, civic,
            and social events. The bulk of this series consists of invitations, correspondence
            related to event planning, programs and bulletins, fliers and advertisements,
            photographs, travel itineraries, press coverage, and thank you notes. The materials also
            include correspondence and arrangements made by Franklin's assistants, Margaret
            Fitzsimmons and Debi Hamlin, written on Franklin's behalf. </p>
          <p>Franklin's work with some organizations spanned many years, even decades, such as his
            work with Phi Delta Kappa, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., and the Board of Foreign
            Scholarships. There are also engagements that involved multiple occurrences such as his
            annual work with the Academy of Senior Professionals at Eckerd College or the Library of
            Congress Kluge Fellowship. For these multi-instance or multi-event engagements, each
            instance is filed separately by month and year. </p>
          <p>Additional materials at the end of the series include two photograph albums with
            portraits dating from 1964-1975 and , and folders with telephone messages dated
            1997-2006, frequent flyer statements dated 1984-1998, travel agency receipts dated
            1991-2001, and day planners dated 1962-2004. There is also a folder with a compiled,
            running list of engagements mostly dated 1960s-1980s, created by Franklin or his
            secretary. This list has been copied and also filed in the folders of the corresponding
            years.</p>
          <p>Additional materials related to Franklin's engagements may be found in the Honors and
            Awards, Service, or Correspondence series. His work on the Advisory Board for the
            President's Initiative on Race is located in its own separate series.</p>

            <p>Album containing 21 8x10 format black-and-white photographic portraits of Franklin
              during his tenure at Brooklyn College, and at various ceremonies. Images from Brooklyn
              show him teaching, posing with students, and standing with Arthur W. Secord, English
              literary scholar and professor born and raised in Oklahoma. Most prints have captions
              on the backs or written on the pages; the handwriting appears to be Aurelia
              Franklin's.</p>

            <p>John Hope Franklin received over 140 honorary degrees in his lifetime. The folders in
              this series typically include correspondence surrounding the logistics of the
              ceremony, programs and bulletins from the event, press coverage, the actual diploma or
              certificate that Franklin received, and thank you notes from Franklin and the other

            <p>The files offer glimpses of the different campuses Franklin visited throughout the
              mid-twentieth century, at times revealing the turmoil and tensions accompanying the
              civil rights movement and Vietnam War protests. Some files include photographs and
              have been noted below. Other files include copies of commencement speeches given by
              Franklin at various graduation ceremonies. </p>
            <p>Oversize diplomas have been removed to Box H7, where they are foldered by decade.</p>

              information about the ceremony, publicity, and the actual certificate. Some notable
              awards, particularly the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1995), also include files of

              photographs of the original plaque are available for researchers if needed. Paper
              certificates have been retained. Oversize certificates have been removed to Box H7,
              Oversize Folder 1, or Box OV1 and OV2.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>Series comprises materials relating to Franklin's life and pursuits outside of his
            scholarship and public service. It also includes materials from other family members,
            particularly his wife, Aurelia Whittington Franklin, whose papers span several boxes;
            their son, John Whittington "Whit" Franklin; and Franklin's father, Buck Colbert
            Franklin. </p>
          <p>The materials have been organized by family member, and within, in rough chronological
            order. A sizable amount of materials have been classified more generally as "Franklin
            Family." This group contains a large amount of photographs of family and friends, many
            of which are snapshots of casual scenes. Miscellaneous photographs of family friends
            have not been arranged. Photographs of family members, particularly John Hope, Aurelia,
            and John W. Franklin, have been sorted by decade, with a large file of miscellaneous and
            undated photographs remaining. Photographs have been sleeved for preservation, with
            labels left visible if present.</p>
          <p>Franklin's professor and mentor, Theodore Currier, is also represented in this series,
            stemming from Franklin's role as executor following Currier's death in 1979. Materials
            relate to the estate settlement, but also include Currier memorabilia such as diplomas
            (1920-1928), Currier's high school yearbook, and other items.</p>
          <p>The series also includes an original painting by the French artist Georges Bigot, who
            worked in Japan in the late nineteenth century. It included no accompanying contextual
            information but appears to have been part of Franklin's art collection. It is filed in
            under John Hope Franklin's subseries.</p>

              <p>The scrapbook measured roughly 12 1/2 x 14 1/2 inches and begins with pages of
                clippings related to the early career of John Hope Franklin, and society events
                attended or hosted by the Franklins. Following are many pages of congratulatory
                cards, telegrams, and letters sent on the occasion of son John Whittington "Whit"
                Franklin's birth in August 1952, and other baby and childhood memorabilia. Loose
                items found in the scrapbook include a few family photographs, a high school
                photobook belonging to Aurelia Franklin, several bills, small publications, larger
                clippings, and other items. The album was dissassembled and pages foldered
                separately; the covers are also in the collection.</p>

          <p>A large set of files relating to Franklin's research as well as personal interests, and
            relating to his life as a public figure, including travel files, photocopies of his FBI
            file, his bibliography and personal statements, and clippings covering his public
            activities from the 1930s through the 2000s. Many of the clippings overlap with events
            highlighted in the Engagements and Honors and Awards Series. Additional clippings from
            Franklin's time as chairman of the Advisory Board for the President's Initiative on Race
            can be found in the ABPIR Series. Series also incluces one microfilm of 1920 U.S. Census
            data from Oklahoma and Colorado.</p>
          <p>The Subject Files subseries includes alphabetized subject files collected by Franklin
            on various topics and people, usually relating to his research and personal interests.
            Contents include clippings, articles, and other printed materials as well as some of
            Franklin's handwritten notes, bibliographies, and outlines. Other files that could be
            considered topical, such as files with information on organizations, are found in the
            Service series.</p>
          <p>Travel guides, maps, and other ephemera collected by the Franklins over their many
            travels have been arranged by geographic region in the Travel Files subseries. </p>
          <p>A small subseries of Research Card Files contain miscellaneous index card series on
            topics such as nineteenth century newspapers, Reconstruction politics, and so on. These
            card files are usually incomplete.</p>

            <p>Franklin's Subject Files include articles, clippings, informational or news-related
              fliers and pamphlets, and some other printed materials. Some files related to
              Franklin's research interests, such as various African American figures and issues,
              while others seem to relate more to his personal interests, like fly fishing and
              orchids.</p>

              clippings covering his interviews, appearances, speeches, and other activities from
              the 1930s through the 2000s. Many of the clippings overlap with events highlighted in
              the Engagements and Honors and Awards Series. Additional clippings from Franklin's
              time as chairman of the Advisory Board for the President's Initiative on Race can be

            service with various organizations and projects. Materials range in date from the 1950s
            through the 2000s and are arranged alphabetically by organization or project name. These

            the civil rights movement (as seen through his work with the NAACP, the NAACP Legal and
            Educational Defense Fund, the US Commission on Civil Rights, and CORE), his prominence

            associations, including the American Historical Association, the Southern Historical
            Association, and the Organization of American Historians), his commitment to scholarship
            and education (as demonstrated by his work on the Fisk University Board of Trustees, Phi
            Beta Kappa, and the Board of Foreign Scholarships), and his wide-ranging community
            service (such as his fundraising for Planned Parenthood, his involvement in different
            museums and parks, and his political engagement with the Democratic Party and opposing
            conservative Supreme Court nominees).</p>

            <p>In December 1963, Zanzibar gained its independence from the British Empire. JHF was
              part of the U.S. Delegation sent to join the celebration. The five 6 1/2 x 8 1/2 inch
              photos, taken by an unknown photographer, show a welcome arch, with "Uhuru,"
              "Karibuni," the year 1963, and two silhouette maps of Zanzibar and Pemba islands;
              native and English officials seated on a stage while a speech is given; dances and
              celebrations; and the 19th century waterfront Sultan's palace in Zanzibar (Beit
              al-Sahel).</p>
