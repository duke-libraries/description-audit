      <abstract id="aspace_1c4c12dd6c511de2a4792dc36c5d2d27">Benjamin Newton Duke (1855-1929) was a
        tobacco manufacturer, industrialist, and philanthropist of Durham, NC and New York, NY and a
        trustee and major benefactor of Trinity College (later Duke University). He was the son of
        Washington Duke, older brother of James B. Duke, husband of Sarah Pearson Angier Duke, and
        father of Angier Buchanan Duke and Mary Duke Biddle. The materials in this collection
        document the business, financial, philanthropic, and personal interests of Benjamin N. Duke
        and his family, especially Duke's involvement in the tobacco, textile, banking, and
        hydroelectric industries in North Carolina and New York and the Duke family's financial
        support of a variety of institutions, including educational institutions for African
        Americans and women, the Methodist Episcopal Church, South and individual churches,
        orphanages, hospitals, and community organizations. The Richard B. Arrington series and
        Alexander H. Sands, Jr., series document the personal and financial interests of Benjamin N.
        Duke's private secretaries in New York, NY.</abstract>

      <p>The papers of Benjamin Newton Duke have been received from a variety of sources over an
        extended period of time. While acquisition information about the bulk of the collection is
        unrecorded, it is believed that it was given by his daughter, Mary Duke Biddle. Additions to
        the collection were made by Mary Duke Biddle, 1939; Alexander H. Sands, Jr., 1940- 1941,
        1953; R.D. Graham, 1950; Mrs. Lucy Cole Durham, 1951; Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans,
        1961-1972, 2019; Bud Alexander, 1970; Duke University Archives, 1980; and Julia Wightman,
        1990.</p>

      <p>Processing Note: In 1991 the Benjamin Newton Duke Papers were reprocessed through the
        support of The Duke Endowment. At that time the collection was arranged by distinct series
        and the papers reboxed and refoldered. While much of the Correspondence and Financial Papers
        Series follow their original order, some rearrangement has been done throughout the
        collection.</p>
      <p>Volumes, once shelved separately, have been integrated into the collection. Examples
        include: letterbooks, check stubs, stock ledgers, oversized memorials, etc.</p>
      <p>During the reprocessing, duplicate printed material was removed. Additionally, three hymn
        books, once belonging to Benjamin and Sarah Duke, have been transferred to the Rare Book
        Collection. These hymnals are for the worship services of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
        South, and date from 1878 and 1889.</p>

              <p>Letters dated 1932 and later are primarily solicitatons made by North Carolina
                institutions that Benjamin N. Duke supported during his lifetime, including Kittrell
                College, the North Carolina College for Negroes, Lincoln Hospital, and West Durham
                Methodist Church. Also included is a letter from Ora J. Swing to Doris Duke

                and Mary Duke at New Garden School in 1871-1872. Swing enclosed a letter written by
                Benjamin to Kate dated June 24, 1872, the original of which is filed chronologically
                in the Correspondence series, folder "1872, 1877, 1879."</p>

            <p>The fragile letterbooks consist of bound carbon-copies of outgoing correspondence as
              well as scattered financial statements. Most letterbooks include alphabetical indexes
              of correspondents. Letters from Duke's Durham and New York offices are bound
              separately, with some overlap in time periods covered. As correspondents directed
              letters to city in which Duke was thought to presently inhabit, correspondence issued
              by either office of origin was not limited to topics particular to that location.</p>
            <p>There are also occasional outgoing letters from Angier B. Duke and Washington Duke,
              with the latter correspondence mainly concerning responses to requests for financial
              assistance.</p>

              <p>These materials are related to Benjamin N. Duke's effort in the mid-1920s to
                identify and provide financial gifts to relatives on the Duke and Roney sides of the
                family. They include tables of disbursments made to family members and
                correspondence with Alexander H. Sands, Jr. related to the project. As the family
                research was later used to settle claims against the James B. Duke estate, related
                correspondence can found in the James Buchanan Duke Papers: Correspondence and
                Estate series.</p>

          <p>A majority of the documents in the Legal series pertain to property transactions of
            Benjamin Newton Duke and other individuals in Orange County, NC and Durham, NC. Property
            deeds dating from 1838 show changes in ownership of land that Duke eventually purchased.
            Other papers include architectural contracts, plans and specifications, trust
            indentures, a legal brief, copies of the wills of Benjamin N. Duke and Washington Duke,
            and materials related to the execution of the estates of Angier B. Duke and Benjamin N.

            management; the purchase of implements, machinery and livestock; the construction of
            barns and other farm improvements; and requests for farm products to be delivered to
            Duke's Durham house and other locations. There is also scattered correspondence related

          <p>The Richard B. Arrington series is composed of the personal papers of Benjamin Newton
            Duke's personal secretary and business agent, who worked in the New York office. This
            series includes letters, letterbook, accounts, check stubs, and receipts. The
            correspondence covers two periods: 1903-1907 and 1911-1914. From 1903 to 1907 the major
            focus is building and furnishing a house on Ridgeview Road in White Plains, N.Y. From
            1911 the emphasis is on Arrington's business interests, including stock transactions and
            insurance. Since Arrington died April 17, 1913, the remainder of the correspondence
            (1913-1914) concerns his estate. His wife, Ethel Lewis Arrington, carried on much of the
            estate's business. The accounts, check stubs and receipts pertain to Arrington's general
            business activities; the major focus is on stock transactions especially of the Piedmont
            Syndicate. Much of his business parallels his work for Benjamin Newton Duke.</p>

          <p>The materials in this series document the personal and financial interests of Alexander
            H. Sands, Jr., a secretary and business agent for Benjamin N. Duke in New York, NY. The
            series includes letters, letterbooks, account book, check registers, check stubs, a
            daybook, ledger and receipts. The correspondence, 1910-1918, primarily concerns Sands's
            family matters and personal business interests. He also supported both his parents, Mary
            Harvey Sands and Tucker K. Sands. The remainder of Sands's papers details stock
            transactions and other business activities, including those of the Southern Audit
            Company of New York, Inc., of which Sands was a partner.</p>
