            from National University (1933), M.B.A. from Bryant and Stratton College in Providence,
            R.I. (1933), and L.H.D. from Rollins College in Winter Park, Fl.(1934). He was a member
            of the American Bar Association; the Board of Stewards; the Democratic Party; the Board
            of Directors for the Atlantic Coast Line Railway; the Board of Education in Washington,
            D.C. (1932); the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (1930); the
            6th Ecumenical Conference (1931); Sigma Alpha Epsilon; Phi Beta Kappa; the Chevy Chase
            Club; the National Press Club; the University Club (Washington, D.C.); and the Masons.
            He was a trustee of Coker College and the American University. Roper was the author of
            The United States Post Office (1917) and Fifty Years in Public Life (1941).</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Daniel C. Roper Papers, 1860-1958 (bulk 1933-1938), consist chiefly of professional
            and political correspondence, including telegrams and memoranda, but also include
            speeches, financial papers, clippings, invitations, legal papers, printed material, and
            pictures. The collection primarily documents Roper's term as Secretary of Commerce
            during the first administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In general the
            papers provide an inside look at this Democratic administration during the early
            depression years, as well as the relationships among business, government, and politics.
            In particular, Roper had close ties to people in the business community and was
            sympathetic to their concerns. In addition, the collection tracks the course of the New
            Deal in the Department of Commerce and the career of Roper not only as a United States
            government official in Roosevelt's cabinet but also as a progressive Democrat. However,
            there are some gaps in these professional files in that there is very little material
            pertaining to Roper's career prior to his appointment to the cabinet post. Also, files
            for 1931 are almost entirely missing, and cross-reference sheets in the collection
            prepared by Roper's staff appear to refer to a separate set of files missing from this
            collection. There is relatively little in the papers concerning Roper's personal life,
            except for financial papers.</p>
         <p>Roper's tenure as Secretary of Commerce is primarily documented in the Alphabetical
            Series, which not only is the largest series but also forms the heart of the collection.
            His support of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential campaign probably helped
            him earn this cabinet appointment along with Roper's representation of the old Woodrow
            Wilson element in the Democratic Party. Roper set as a major task the development of
            mutual confidence, cooperation, and a closer relationship between business and
            government in order to bring about a recovery from the depression. Since he had been a
            tax expert and business consultant prior to becoming Secretary, this was a natural role
            for him. In fact in 1933 he had organized a Business Advisory and Planning Council for
            the Department of Commerce to advise the administration on the effect of the New Deal's
            proposals on business. After serving in the administration for almost six years, Roper
            resigned to return to private life.</p>
         <p>The Alphabetical Series includes correspondence from a large number of prominent
            senators and congressmen, men in government service, businessmen, lawyers, judges, and
            New Deal figures. These include Bernard Baruch, James Byrnes, Patrick Callahan, James
            Cannon, Thomas Chadbourne, David Coker, Homer Cummings, Josephus Daniels, William Dodd,
            Ernest Draper, Robert Elbert, James Farley, John Garner, and W. Averell Harriman. Other
            correspondents are William Henry Harrison, Edward House, Louis Howe Cordell Hull,
            Clarence Hurrey, Jesse Jones, Hugh MacRae, William Gibbs McAdoo, George Milton, Robert
            Owen, Hollins Randolph, Lawrence Robert, L.S. Rowe, and John Humphrey Small. The Farley
            correspondence includes a run of first day covers, 1933-1938, while he was Postmaster
            General. Roper's interest in the stamps was piqued in part by the fact that he had been
            the First Assistant Postmaster General appointed by Woodrow Wilson. There are smaller
            amounts of correspondence with other New Deal figures, such as Harry Hopkins, Frances
            Perkins, and Harold Ickes.</p>
         <p>Information on organizations and topics is scattered throughout the Alphabetical Series.
            They include aeronautics (in Aviation folder); American University; the Board of
            Education of the District of Columbia; commerce (in Foreign Trade folder); communication
            (radio and telegraph); financial federations, specifically The Community Chest of
            Washington, D.C.; the Democratic National Committee; the Democratic Party (in Politics
            folder); Duke University; the Export-Import Bank of Washington; and the Hindenburg
            accident. Others are the Freemasons (in Masons folder); Japanese Economic Mission to the
            United States; the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (also in Methodist Church and Mt.
            Vernon Place Church folders); the National Benefit Life Assurance Company; the National
            Recovery Administration; the Post Office Department; the presidential election of 1932
            (in Politics folder); prohibition; religion and politics; Franklin D. Roosevelt; and
            temperance and liquor laws (in Liquor Control folder). Roper supported prohibition and
            in fact had served during the prohibition era as Commissioner of Internal Revenue in the
            Treasury Department, charged with enforcing liquor laws. There is information about
            agencies within or related to the Department of Commerce including the Business Advisory
            Council, the Bureau of the Census (in Census folder), the Bureau of Fisheries (in
            Fisheries folder), and the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce (in Foreign and
            Domestic folder). Other topics represented in the collection include the Boxing Bill;
            the Communications Group; the Inter-departmental Communications Committee (in
            Communications Committee folder), probably a precursor of the Federal Communications
            Commission; and a proposed National Advisory Council.</p>
         <p>Roper's professional views are expressed in the Writings and Speeches Series primarily
            while he served as Commissioner of Internal Revenue and as Secretary of Commerce. The
            speeches address a number of domestic political and economic issues, including the
            relationship of business and government, government regulation, taxation, economic
            recovery from the depression, the U.S. Postal Service, and the role of government in
            society.</p>
         <p>There is scant evidence in these papers relating to Roper's career other than that as
            Secretary of Commerce and his speeches as Commissioner of Internal Revenue. His
            autobiography, Fifty Years of Public Life in the Writings and Speeches Series, gives an
            overview of his career. There is some information on his career as the First Assistant
            Postmaster General in the Alphabetical Series in the Postmaster General file. In that
            series there is a little information in Internal Revenue Service folders about his
            resignation as Commissioner. In the Clippings Series there is documentation of his brief
            service as U.S. Minister to Canada in the summer of 1939. There is a scrapbook, "My
            Clippings of Their Majesties' Visit to Canada, 1939," and loose clippings pertaining to
            the visit.</p>
         <p>Roper's personal life is not well documented in the collection except for his financial
            concerns as seen in the Financial Papers Series. The information in that series relates
            not only to the investments and bank accounts of Roper but to his wife Lou McKenzie
            Roper and their children. There is some additional information on the Ropers in the
            various Roper folders and in other scattered folders under various topics in the
            Alphabetical Series, and in the Legal Papers and Pictures in the Miscellaneous
            Series.</p>
         <p>A photograph album entitled, "Sugar: Story in Pictures," concerning sugar growing in
            Santo Domingo appears in the Miscellaneous Series. In addition this series contains
            photographs of prominent statesmen and others, such as Bernard Baruch, the British Royal
            family, William Jennings Bryan, Grover Cleveland, Josephus Daniels, Averell Harriman,
            Harold Ickes, Eleanor Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow
            Wilson. An oil portrait of Roper is in the custody of the Special Collections Library.
            The Clippings Series includes scattered information on farming in South Carolina,
            especially cotton, African Americans, racial relations, tariffs, the presidential
            campaign of 1924 and William Gibbs McAdoo, and Roosevelt's cabinet.</p>

               <p>Chiefly typed, professional correspondence to and from Roper, including telegrams,
                  memoranda and carbon copies of Roper's outgoing mail. The bulk was generated
                  during Roper's tenure as Secretary of Commerce. A variety of other material
                  scattered throughout the files includes printed material in the form of pamphlets,
                  booklets, and serials; press releases from the Department of Commerce; reports;
                  addresses by Roper and others; charts and graphs; organizational records from
                  various groups including minutes, budgets, and agendas; clippings; and
                  photographs. A series of folders contains first day covers given to Roper by
                  Postmaster James A. Farley. There is a small amount of personal correspondence and
                  financial information. Two volumes of correspondence are at the end of the series.
                  They are a letterbook of congratulations upon Roper's appointment as Secretary of
                  Commerce with copies of Roper's replies, and "Special Letters of Congratulation to
                  Daniel C. Roper, March 4, 1933," with Roper's replies. Cross-reference sheets
                  prepared by Roper's staff are found frequently throughout the series, many of
                  which appear to refer to a separate set of files not in this collection.</p>

               <p>Chiefly typed transcripts, in bound and loose form, of Roper's public addresses

               <p>Contains records of the personal finances of Roper, his wife, and children,
                  including investments in a number of businesses and real estate holdings,
                  primarily in the form of correspondence with bankers, stock brokers and tenants.
                  Also contains balance sheets; tax returns; records of stock transfer; lists of
                  assets; profit and loss statements; financial statements from banks, brokerage
                  houses, and various companies; receipts for dividends and taxes; and a few
                  mortgage and lease agreements. Roper held major accounts with the City Bank
                  Farmers' Trust Company (previously Farmers' Loan and Trust Company). Includes a
                  number of financial record books documenting the above investments. A scrapbook
                  generated by Roper's employment at the Marlin Rockwell Corporation contains
                  correspondence, legal agreements, financial records, clippings, reports, and
                  receipts.</p>
