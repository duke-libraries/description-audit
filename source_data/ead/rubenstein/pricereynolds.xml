        Eudora Welty, and Allan Gurganus. Writings include manuscripts, typescripts, proofs,
        outlines, and notes produced in the creation and publication of all his major works,
        including: A Long and Happy Life; Kate Vaiden; A Palpable God; Clear Pictures; A Whole New
        Life; The Collected Stories; The Collected Poems; A Letter to a Godchild; Ardent Spirits;
        The Good Priest's Son, and many other books, individual stories, poems, and

      <head>Related Materials</head>
      <p>Materials related to the life and career of Reynolds Price appear in several other
        collections housed at the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library. The <emph
          render="bold">Clear Pictures Film Footage Collection</emph> houses materials created and
        used by Charles Guggenheim in making his 1994 documentary film about Price's life (based on
        Price's own 1989 memoir of the same title). The collection includes many materials that do
        not appear in the published version of the film: research, film footage of interviews of and
        about Price, and electronic files. Documentation of Price's professional writing career
        appears in the records of the <emph render="bold">Harriet Wasserman Literary Agency Records.
        </emph> Materials there include correspondence, drafts and published versions of his works,
        and publishing contracts both with this agency and with Russell and Volkening, Wasserman's
        employer prior to forming her own agency. Extensive documentation of Price's publishing
        history can be found in the <emph render="bold">Jody Jones Hunter Collection of Works by
          Reynolds Price.</emph> In addition to copies of Price's books with major commercial
        publishers, the Hunter collection also contains many small press publications, limited
        editions, periodicals, and audiovisual materials. Finally, the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book
        &amp; Manuscript Library contains copies of many publications similar to those in the Hunter
        collection. These items, cataloged separately from the Reynolds Price Papers, are searchable
        by individual title in the Duke University Libraries online catalog.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence Series is divided into the Correspondence, chronological subseries
            and the Correspondence, alphabetical by name subseries. Materials arrived in different
            accessions and original divisions have been retained. The subseries includes multiple
            runs of general correspondence arranged in a loose chronological order. The
            chronological correspondence consists of letters to and from family, friends, teachers,
            and admirers of his work. Early letters vividly depict his relationships with family
            members and friends. Many of the letters dated between 1954 and 1958 concern his
            education at Duke University and as a Rhodes Scholar at Merton College, Oxford
            University. His early development as an author is documented here as well as in the
            Writings Series. From 1961 onward, letters also provide information about his career as
            a professor at Duke University. The alphabetical correspondence subseries comprises
            correspondence between Price and other writers, literary figures, celebrities, and close
            friends. These letters concern both personal and literary matters. Frequently the
            correspondents commented on each other's recent publications or on work in progress.
            Numerous letters to and from Eudora Welty and Stephen Spender reveal much about their
            strong influence on Price's development as a writer. The series also contains a great
            many letters from Allan Gurganus; Polly Holliday; Jeff Humphries; Josephine Humphreys;
            Wallace Kaufman; Joe Porter; Lee Smith; and William Blackburn.</p>

          <p>The (2) Writings Series contains various writings by Price and is divided into the
            Books, Scribner's Files, Uncollected Fiction and Nonfiction, Price Writing in Serials,
            Reviews by Price, Addresses and Speeches, and Audiovisual Recordings of Price Regarding
            Writing subseries. The Books subseries is composed chiefly of drafts, typescripts, and
            proofs of Price's novels, plays, autobiographical works, and volumes of poetry, many
            with Price's notations and revisions, and provides a thorough representation of the
            development of each. Following his death, DUL received the materials for the books
            Letter to a Godchild; Ardent Spirits; and, Midstream, which were added to their own
            sub-subseries. Scribner, Price's longtime publisher, provided the materials in
            Scribner's Files, offering insight into the publishing process. Materials include
            correspondence, proposals, editing and production notes, marketing and promotion
            information, and reviews. The Price Writing in Serials subseries contains published
            essays, poems, and short stories. The Reviews by Price subseries includes Price's
            writing about other artists' work. Transcripts of his speeches and interviews appear in
            the Speeches and Addresses subseries. And the Audiovisual Recordings of Price Regarding
            Writing subseries includes recordings of Price discussing, reading, or performing his
            written materials and is arranged chronologically.</p>

              publications and limited editions) appear in order of publication date. For each book,
              materials are then arranged in order of their writing and editing history. In cases of
              approximate or inferred dates, strict chronological order is occasionally ignored,
              with the main sequence of writing and editing the text--as reflected in notes,
              manuscripts, typescripts, and proofs--being favored over such later matters in the
              publication process as jacket copy, ads, and adaptations into other genres and media
              (such as screenplays and audiobooks).</p>

            <p>Materials in this subseries include drafts, proofs, typescripts and fragments of
              uncollected poetry, fiction, and nonfiction. Some nonfiction materials in this
              subseries appear to have been gathered by Price and assigned this title in the early
              1970s during preparation for his first nonfiction collection, Things Themselves, as
              some notes and outlines recorded here reflect the final structure of that book. The
              subseries also contains a mix of titles later collected in A Common Room; uncollected
              titles that appear in their own named folders elsewhere in the Reynolds Price Papers;
              and other manuscripts that are unique to this subseries. Further materials reflect
              drafts and typescripts of uncollected works which are unpublished, or published in
              short format. Price's early student work from high school through his years at Oxford
              is included here. The materials are arranged chronologically.</p>
