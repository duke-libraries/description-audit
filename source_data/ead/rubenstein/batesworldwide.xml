      <abstract id="aspace_5ae16712dd681b865483ef952fddf654">Bates Worldwide advertising agency
        (Bates) was established in 1940 by former executives of the Benton &amp; Bowles agency. It
        grew to become one of the largest agencies in the U.S. until its demise in 2003. Bates began
        as a simple proprietorship, but as the company grew its organizational structure took on
        different forms: a partnership, then a corporation before becoming a publicly traded
        transnational entity, and finally becoming a subsidiary in a global holding company. From
        the 1970s on, Bates' growth and international expansion was fueled by a long series of
        mergers, partnerships and acquisitions that continued until the company was itself acquired,
        first by the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and later by the WPP Group. Materials in the collection
        relate to Bates' permutations into a variety of corporate entities, including Ted Bates
        &amp; Co., Ted Bates, Inc., Backer Spielvogel Bates, and Bates Worldwide, Inc., along with
        its subsidiaries (such as Campbell-Mithun and Kobs and Draft) and parent organizations
        (Cordiant Communications Group, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi). Thus, the collection provides a
        window into the larger corporate culture of mergers, consolidations, acquisitions and
        takeovers that led to the formation of giant transnational advertising conglomerates and
        marked a profound shift in the landscape of the advertising industry during the late 20th
        century. The Bates Worldwide, Inc. Records spans the years 1934-2003 and includes
        correspondence, corporate policy manuals, photographs, publications, graphic designs, print
        advertisements, electronic records and videocassettes that document the activities of this
        major global advertising agency over the course of its corporate life. Bates built its early
        reputation as an advertising agency with a particular talent for promoting pharmaceutical
        products (Carter's Pills, Anacin analgesics) and common household goods (Mars candies,
        Wonder bread, Palmolive soap, Colgate dental cream). Advertising policies developed around a
        philosophy Bates called the Unique Selling Proposition (USP), which informed an imperative
        to identify and promote a single, unique and compelling reason for consumers to use any
        given product or service. As the company grew into a global business, USP evolved into more
        complex forms, including the Bates Brand Wheel. Major clients included Brown &amp;
        Williamson Tobacco Co., Carter-Wallace Corporation, Hyundai America, the Joint Recruiting
        Advertising Program of the combined U.S. Armed Services, M&amp;M/Mars Inc., Miller Brewing
        Company, Pfizer, the U.S. Navy and Wendy's International. There is also some information on
        the company's founder, Ted Bates, as well as on Rosser Reeves, Bates' first copy writer and
        the chief architect of the USP concept.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Bates Worldwide, Inc. (<emph render="doublequote">Bates</emph>)
          Records</emph> span the years 1934-2003 and include correspondence, corporate policy
        manuals, photographs, publications, graphic designs, print advertisements, electronic
        records and videocassettes that document the activities of this major global advertising
        agency over the course of its corporate life. Bates began as a simple proprietorship, but as
        the company grew its organizational structure took on different forms: a partnership, then a
        corporation before becoming a publicly traded transnational entity, and finally becoming a
        subsidiary in a global holding company. From the 1970s on, Bates' growth and international
        expansion was fueled by a long series of mergers, partnerships and acquisitions that
        continued until the company was itself acquired, first by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and later by
        the WPP Group. Materials in the collection relate to Bates' permutations into a variety of
        corporate entities, including Ted Bates &amp; Co., Ted Bates, Inc., Backer Spielvogel Bates,
        and Bates Worldwide, Inc., along with its subsidiaries (such as Campbell-Mithun and Kobs and
        Draft) and parent organizations (Cordiant Communications Group, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi).
        Thus, the collection provides a window into the larger corporate culture of mergers,
        consolidations, acquisitions and takeovers that led to the formation of giant transnational
        advertising conglomerates and marked a profound shift in the landscape of the advertising
        industry during the late 20th century. </p>
      <p>Bates built its early reputation as an advertising agency with a particular talent for
        promoting pharmaceutical products (Carter's Pills, Anacin analgesics) and common household
        goods (Mars candies, Wonder bread, Palmolive soap, Colgate dental cream). Advertising
        policies developed around a philosophy Bates called the Unique Selling Proposition (USP),
        which informed an imperative to identify and promote a single, unique and compelling reason
        for consumers to use any given product or service. As the company grew into a global
        business, USP evolved into more complex forms, including the Bates Brand Wheel. Major
        clients include Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Co., Carter-Wallace Corporation,
        Colgate-Palmolive Company, Hyundai America, the Joint Recruiting Advertising Program of the
        combined U.S. Armed Services, M&amp;M/Mars Inc., Miller Brewing Company, Pfizer, the U.S.
        Navy and Wendy's International. There is also some information on the company's founder, Ted
        Bates, as well as on Rosser Reeves, Bates' first copy writer and the chief architect of the
        USP concept. </p>
      <p>The collection is organized into ten series and one cumulative subject index--Client Files,
        Corporate Communications Department, Creative Department, Financial Records, Human Resources
        Department, Memorabilia, New Business, Print Books, Vertical Files and Audiovisual
        Materials. The <emph render="bold">Client Files Series</emph> includes research reports,
        storyboards and graphic designs for Bates' clients. The <emph render="bold">Corporate
          Communications Department Series</emph> includes company-wide memoranda, public relations
        policy manuals, and a large file of biographical sketches and photographs of Bates'
        executives, as well as news clippings and press releases relating to the company and its
        clients. The <emph render="bold">Creative Department Series</emph> primarily focuses on
        Bates' efforts to stimulate creativity throughout its worldwide offices through
        participation in internal and industry-wide advertising competitions. The <emph
          render="bold">Financial Records Series</emph> includes general ledgers and other
        accounting reports. The <emph render="bold">Human Resources Department Series</emph>
        includes employee benefits literature and information on company affairs including press
        releases and staff memoranda. The <emph render="bold">Memorabilia Series</emph> includes
        promotional clothing, games, office posters and awards. The <emph render="bold">New Business
          Series</emph> includes materials relating to requests for proposals from prospective
        clients. The <emph render="bold">Print Books Series</emph> contains material from over 100
        albums of proof sheets and print advertisements from existing clients. The <emph
          render="bold">Vertical Files Series</emph> consists of an alphabetical file of general
        information collected to aid in various aspects of company operations. The <emph
          render="bold">Audiovisual Materials Series</emph> contains periodic review collections of
        advertising, video memoranda, speeches, retirement presentations and highlight compilations
        prepared for prospective clients and award show consideration. A <emph render="bold">Subject
          Cross-Reference Index</emph> at the end of the finding aid links materials pertaining to
        specific clients, corporations, events and policies scattered throughout the various subject
        series.</p>
      <p>Some materials were received as electronic files. Disks were assigned consecutive numbers
        reflecting the order in which they were encountered. If a work has a corresponding or
        associated electronic file, the file is included in the container list. The contents of each
        disk have been migrated to the Special Collections server. Consequently, the contents of
        these disks are available only in correspondingly numbered electronic subdirectories.
        Consult a reference archivist for access to the electronic files.</p>

          <p>Corporate reports, correspondence and memoranda, press releases, news clippings,
            general office files and photographs that originated in or were maintained by Bates
            Corporate Communications Department. The series dates between 1940-2003 and primarily
            documents the corporate public relations, news events and publicity activities of Bates
            offices, personnel and clients. The materials contained in the series thus record mainly
            newsworthy events, as opposed to daily operations--client relationships and advertising
            campaigns rather than account management specifics, or, promotion announcements rather
            than personnel employment records. Other files reflect materials in general distribution
            throughout the corporation. Some of the material contained in the series, primarily news
            clippings, originated in the corporate Information Center. The series is organized into
            seven subseries--<emph render="bold">General Office Files</emph>, <emph render="bold"
              >Clients</emph>, <emph render="bold">Media</emph>, <emph render="bold"
            >Meetings</emph>, <emph render="bold">Mergers and Acquisitions</emph>, <emph
              render="bold">Offices</emph>, and <emph render="bold">People</emph>--and arranged
            alphabetically therein.</p>
          <p>Some materials were received as electronic files. Disks were assigned consecutive
            numbers reflecting the order in which they were encountered. If a work has a
            corresponding or associated electronic file, the file is included in the container list.
            The contents of each disk have been migrated to the electronic records server.
            Consequently, the contents of these disks are available only in correspondingly numbered
            electronic subdirectories. Consult a reference archivist for access to the electronic
            files.</p>

            <p>Reports, clippings, correspondence, and printed materials that document Corporate
              Communications' task of staying abreast of what was said about Bates, its clients and
              key executives in the news and trade press. While the subseries does include some
              information on media as an advertising resource (media buying manuals, a media
              glossary, etc.), the bulk of the subseries consists of a long run of weekly news
              clipping files, <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Today's Press,</title> which
              were produced by the Corporate Communications Department and distributed to key

            <p>Presentations, speeches, photographs, and correspondence relating to corporate and
              industry-wide meetings--including the American Advertising Federation luncheons, the
              Pan-American CEO Institute Roundtable, the Conference Board West Coast Marketing
              Symposium, and Bates' own Worldwide Management Meetings. The American Advertising
              Federation luncheons honored two Bates executives (Rosser Reeves in 1994, William
              Backer in 1996) who were inducted into their Advertising Hall of Fame. Two meetings,
              the Pan-American CEO Institute Roundtable and the Conference Board West Coast
              Marketing Symposium, both held in 1992, discussed the implications the newly enacted
              North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The two Worldwide Management Meetings
              reconsidered Bates' corporate brand identity as a global advertising agency. The 1996
              meeting, in particular, focused on creative aspects of advertising and inaugurated the
              internal <emph render="doublequote">Best of Bates</emph> competitions. (For more on
              this competition, see the <emph render="bold">Creative Department Series</emph>).

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>In 1994, Backer Spielvogel Bates renamed itself Bates Worldwide and embarked on a
            project to create a new corporate brand identity as a global advertising agency. The new
            branding emphasized the creative aspects of advertising. It was a way of reinvigorating
            the concept of the Unique Selling Proposition (USP), Bates's traditional advertising
            philosophy--every successful product inherently contained a unique or compelling idea
            (or proposition) that made the product attractive to consumers, and successful
            advertising identified that unique idea and linked it to a consumer's life needs. This
            project led to the creation of a Global Creative Board and inaugurated an annual
            internal creative competition known variously as <emph render="doublequote">Best of
              Bates</emph> or <emph render="doublequote">Bates's Best,</emph> the first awards for
            which were given during the Worldwide Management Meeting in 1996. The Creative
            Department was charged with coordinating this yearly competition and helped in the
            selection of entries for various industry-wide awards competitions. </p>
          <p>The <emph render="bold">Creative Department Series</emph> includes entry forms,
            memoranda, print advertisement proofs and photocopies, slides and printed material. The
            series dates between 1980s-2003, but most of the materials date from 1997-2002 and
            document the Creative Department's coordination of internal and external awards
            competitions, in particular the annual <emph render="doublequote">Best of Bates</emph>
            program. It includes a significant portion of international advertisements; however, the
            files do not represent the total output of Bates Worldwide offices. Rather, they reflect
            what Bates's various international offices considered their best work for the period
            covered herein. They provide a glimpse into some of Bates's international campaigns and
            creative output for clients such as Arnott's department store (Ireland),
            Audi/Volkswagen, Caltex, Camel cigarettes, Heineken, Le Meridien hotels, Land Rover,
            Nokia cellular phones, Pfizer, Royal Mail of Australia, Seat automobiles, and Thames
            bottled water. Many of the submission forms (some are still attached to the submitted
            item) for these competitive entries include a description of the USP that informed the
            advertisement's design. In addition, the series contains general files pertaining to
            other Creative Department operations and activities. </p>
          <p>The series is organized into three subseries--<emph render="bold">Creative
              Binders</emph>, <emph render="bold">Print Advertisements</emph> and <emph
              render="bold">Office Files</emph>--that reflect the various formats of materials in
            the series. Both the <emph render="bold">Creative Binders Subseries</emph> and the <emph
              render="bold">Print Advertisements Subseries</emph> contain examples of advertisements
            entered into competitive events, which are present in varying formats--slides, proofs,
            tear sheets, and photocopies. There is some redundancy to the container list: because of
            the various formats it was not feasible to house all materials pertaining to a specific
            client together. Thus, portions of the container list repeat client names.</p>

              technology, as well as files relating to executives such as John Fawcett, supporting

              advertising industry awards competitions, as well as correspondence and submission

              Some of the images in the awards booklets represent Bates award-winning entries, but
              there is little documentation about the actual entry submissions themselves, nor are
              the actual submission procedures for external awards competitions well-documented

            <p>Orientation materials for new employees, benefits packages (insurance, profit
              sharing, retirement), job descriptions, manuals for supervisors, performance
              evaluation guidelines and training materials. Included is information on the Unique
              Selling Proposition (USP) as Bates' guiding philosophy, employee training in USP, and
              case studies of significant USP campaigns, such as Certs and Nicorette. USP was the
              constant corporate principle that survived Bates' long history of name changes and
              mergers. The first part of the series is arranged alphabetically by company or
              subsidiary name, followed by files relating to USP that are arranged alphabetically by
              topic.</p>

          <p>Correspondence, letters of introduction, mailings, research reports, presentations and
            other printed materials. The series spans 1973-2003, but most of the materials fall
            between 1993 and 2003, and represent Bates' pursuit of new business accounts through its
            various New Business departments during the final decade of the company's existence. The
            series is organized into three subseries--General Files, Competing Agencies, and
            Companies--and alphabetically therein.</p>
          <p>Some large-format items have been removed to special boxes. Items have been linked to
            the pertinent subseries by a dummy file, which title appears in brackets.</p>
          <p>Audiovisual materials have been removed to the <emph render="bold">Audiovisual
              Materials Series</emph>. Originals are closed to use. Technical Services staff need to
            produce use copies before contents can be accessed. Please consult with Research
            Services staff before requesting audiovisual materials.</p>
          <p>Some materials were received as electronic files. Disks were assigned consecutive
            numbers reflecting the order in which they were encountered. If a work has a
            corresponding or associated electronic file, the file is included in the container list.
            The contents of each disk have been migrated to the electronic records server.
            Consequently, the contents of these disks are available only in correspondingly numbered
            electronic subdirectories. Consult a reference archivist for access to the electronic
            files.</p>

            <p>Letters of introduction, correspondence, mailings, and presentation materials that
              document Bates' active pursuit of new business. Over 400 companies and/or products are
              represented, although most of the files are limited to contact letters (feelers) that
              Bates' offices sent out to prospective clients, along with some responses to requests
              for information and follow-up communication. Some companies' files, however, are more
              extensive, comprising research reports, credentials presentations, analyses of a
              prospective client's competing products, and account planning strategies, and provide
              a glimpse into the actual process Bates undertook to win new business accounts. These
              companies include Amtrak, Bali Company, Bank of America, Bell South, Chevron-Texaco,
              Coca-Cola Company, Colgate-Palmolive, A.T. Cross, Delta Airlines, IKEA, Jenny Craig,
              KPMG, Marconi PLC, Motorola, New York Lottery, Nokia, the Office of National Drug
              Control Policy, Parmalat, Petsmart, Reckitt-Benckiser, Sara Lee Lingerie, Sunkist
              Growers, Inc., Unisys, the U.S. Navy and WebMD. Arranged alphabetically by client
              name.</p>

          <p>Print proofs, tear sheets and photocopies of print advertisements maintained in print
            books by the Print Production Department, which was responsible for producing these
            advertisements in various sizes, colors, and shapes. Entries in the books were
            apparently made as the advertisements were created. The print books thus reflect Bates'
            domestic client roster over time and constitute a representative sampling of Bates'
            North American output for the years covered. (For examples of Bates' international work,
            see the <emph render="bold">Creative Department Series</emph>.) Major clients
            represented include Avis, Campbell's Soup Company, Carter-Wallace, Cunard Lines, Foot
            Locker, Hyundai, Kal Kan, Lancaster, M&amp;M/Mars, Miller Brewing Co., Paddington,
            Panasonic, Prudential-Bache, T. Rowe Price, Trans-World Airlines (TWA), U.S. Navy,
            Warner-Lambert, Wendy's International, and Westvaco. The files are organized into two
            lists--chronological and alphabetical. There is considerable date overlap in the
            chronological listings, largely due to the vaying durations of Bates' client
            relationships.</p>

          <p>Audio and video tapes in multiple formats that include speeches, video memoranda,
            historical overviews and testimonials which commemorate company events such as
            anniversaries, retirements, and office openings, or pay tribute to the work and legacies
            of key executives. The series is organized into two categories--Audiovisual Materials
            Pulled from Other Series and Audiovisual Materials Added to Collection. Materials pulled
            from the other series have been arranged alphabetically according to the series titles
            in which they were originally housed, and therein alphabetically by topic and item
            title. Materials added to the collection have been arranged alphabetically according to
            the corporate identity responsible for the item's production, and therein alphabetically
            by topic and item title. Each item has been assigned a unique number that will be used
            to manage the production of any use copies requested by researchers.</p>
