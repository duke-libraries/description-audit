         <p>Restrictions on the use of the collection largely determined the manner in which it was

         <p>Since these restrictions required examining each item to determine whether it could be

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The Harriet Wasserman Literary Agency (HWLA) was formed in 1981 by Harriet Wasserman,
            formerly an agent at the Russell and Volkening Literary Agency beginning in 1965. A
            number of prominent American writers Wasserman represented at Russell and Volkening came
            with her when she formed her own agency. Thus, while the bulk of the HWLA records
            document her clients' careers after 1981, a number also reach back into the 1970s and
            document such early clients as Saul Bellow, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, and Reynolds
            Price.</p>
      </bioghist>
      <scopecontent id="aspace_23476d2731efa7dbd6f5dd32847c4a36">
         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The records of the Harriet Wasserman Literary Agency span the dates 1948-1993, with most
            of the records dating after 1974. The records dated prior to 1981, when the agency was
            formed, are those of writers who were Wasserman's clients when she was employed at the
            Russell and Volkening agency and stayed with her when she formed her own agency. The
            collection documents the careers of individual writers and in doing so indicates the
            varied activities of a major literary agency: preparation and submission of manuscripts,
            negotiation of contracts, handling of foreign and reprint rights, publicity, and the
            differing ways affairs are handled for lesser known or beginning writers and for major
            authors. Among the more prominent American fiction writers included are Richard Bausch,
            Saul Bellow, Frederick Buechner, Oscar Hijuelos, Josephine Humphreys, Ruth Prawer
            Jhabvala, Alice McDermott, and Reynolds Price. In addition, records about historian
            George F. Kennan and philosopher and historian Allan Bloom are included. The
            correspondence is primarily about professional matters, although some sense of the
            personal relationships between the agent and the more prominent clients can be
            gleaned.</p>
         <p>By far, the Bellow papers comprise the largest group relating to any single author, and
            cover the longest span of years, from 1948 to 1993. There are relatively few papers from
            1948 to 1972, but those present contain a few personal letters to Bellow from his
            contemporaries such as the novelists Ralph Ellison and Wright Morris. The bulk of the
            Bellow papers date from 1973, and convey a clear impression of the activity surrounding
            his increasing fame, particularly with the publication of Humboldt's Gift, the 1975
            Pulitzer Prize for that novel, and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1976. After that
            date his later career is sketched in detail and follows from inception through
            publication such works as <title type="simple" render="italic">The Dean's
               December,</title>
            <title type="simple" render="italic">More Die of Heartbreak,</title> and <title
               type="simple" render="italic">It All Adds Up.</title>
         </p>
         <p>The collection includes, in smaller amounts, material about the careers of other
            authors. In the current accession, the Bausch and Jhabvala papers are particularly rich
            among the fiction writers. Bausch's career is outlined from his breaking into the
            profession in the mid-1970s to his establishment as a major author by the late 1980s.
            Jhabvala's papers pick up in mid-career, when she has already published several novels
            and won the Booker Prize in England, but prior to her growing fame as a screenwriter for
            Merchant Ivory Productions. Her correspondence also includes a number of letters from
            director James Ivory and producer Ismail Merchant, particularly relating to the
            development of the film <title type="simple" render="italic">The Autobiography of a
               Princess</title> (1975) and the accompanying photography book of the same name.</p>
         <p>Of special note are the records about Reynolds Price and Josephine Humphreys. While the
            HWLA collection contains some unique items about these writers, especially Price,
            scholars should be aware that the Library is also the primary repository for the
            personal papers of these writers. Much more information is available in their respective
            collections.</p>
         <p>Among non-fiction writers in the current (1995) accession, the papers of historian
            George F. Kennan and philosopher Allan Bloom document their careers in the 1980s. Most
            of the Bloom papers relate to the publicity surrounding the publication of <title
               type="simple" render="italic">The Closing of the American Mind,</title> particularly
            reviews and speaking engagements. The Kennan material is more varied, including not only
            Wasserman's correspondence on Kennan's behalf, but several dozen lengthy letters from
            Kennan to Wasserman and others.</p>
         <p>The 1999 addition (accession #1999-0275) (19,500 items, 32.5 lin. ft.; dated 1974-1999
            and undated) expands on all of the collection series, especially materials related to
            Saul Bellow.</p>
         <p>The 2001 addition (accession #2001-0050) (816 items, 12 lin. ft.; dated 1974-2000 and
            undated) includes book manuscripts, galley proofs (some inscribed), correspondence,
            notes, and other materials relating to the authors represented by the literary agency.
            Other materials include sixty-four black-and-white photographs, one black-and-white
            negative, four color photographs, and one audiocassette tape. Authors included in this
            addition are Richard Bausch, Jay Williams, Suzi-Lori Parks, Laurel Lee, Karla Kuskin,
            Elinore Clark, Perrin Ireland, Frederick Buechner, John Tyler Bonner, Martha Moody,
            Eugene Walter, Caroline Winthrop, Paul Lussier, Sharon Flake, Reynolds Price, Josephine
            Humphreys, Saul Bellow, George Dawson and Richard Glaubman, Julia Markus, George F.
            Kennan, Carole L. Glickfeld, Mark Winegardner, Michael Stewart, Diane Vreuls, Sandra
            Gould Ford, Charles McPhee, Mark Smith, and Harriet Wasserman herself.</p>
         <p>The second 2001 addition (accession #2001-0115) (5 items, .1 linear feet; dated
            1978-2001, bulk 1997-2001) contains correspondence between Wasserman and Shelley
            Gruskin. It also includes a playbill for performances of <title type="simple"
               render="italic">In Dreams Begin Responsibilities</title> and <title type="simple"
               render="italic">Gimpel the Fool,</title> signed by actor David Marguiles and a copy
            of Delmore Schwartz's <title type="simple" render="italic">In Dreams Begin
               Responsibilities and Other Stories.</title> Both book and playbill are mentioned in
            the correspondence.</p>
         <p>The 2003 addition (accession #2003-0051)(12,500 items, 30 linear feet, dated 1982-2000)
            consists chiefly of client files (correspondence, contracts, financial records, etc.),
            manuscripts and proofs of books by clients, published versions of books by clients, and
            related materials. Includes especially significant material for Saul Bellow and a few
            other authors, including Oscar Hijuelos and George Frost Kennan.</p>

                     Additionally, a few of the restricted papers are correspondence about
                     unpublished works by major authors, the bulk of whose correspondence is open.

                  <p>The <emph render="bold">Open subseries</emph> is mainly the correspondence of
                     authors for whom the Library decided to do item-level processing (see <emph
                        render="bold">Processing Note and Restrictions</emph>). In addition it
                     contains the correspondence of three authors processed at the folder level,
                     Allan Bloom, Coral Lansbury, and Anne Lindbergh. Since these authors are
                     already deceased, financial papers and documents about unpublished works were
                     not restricted and thus not separated from other correspondence.</p>
                  <p>A few folders in the Saul Bellow correspondence are of special note. The
                     folders for his early correspondence, mainly prior to <unitdate era="ce"
                        calendar="gregorian" type="inclusive">1970</unitdate>, contain, in addition
                     to correspondence from the Russell and Volkening Agency, a few substantive
                     letters from prominent writers, most notably American novelists Ralph Ellison
                     and Wright Morris. This also applies to a later group of folders, <emph
                        render="bold">1985. Lois Phillips Files</emph>. In the <unitdate era="ce"
                        calendar="gregorian" type="inclusive">1980s</unitdate> Lois Phillips
                     discovered these files in a house near hers that Bellow lived in from the late
                        <unitdate era="ce" calendar="gregorian" type="inclusive">1950s</unitdate> to
                     the early <unitdate era="ce" calendar="gregorian" type="inclusive"
                        >1960s</unitdate>. Like other of his papers from that period, they contain
                     some personal correspondence from writers. Because of the way in which these
                     papers were found and the correspondence in the <unitdate era="ce"
                        calendar="gregorian" type="inclusive">1980s</unitdate> between Phillips and
                     Harriet Wasserman about their disposition, correspondence and financial papers
                     were kept together chronologically in their respective series rather than
                     separated and refiled to the time period in which they were written.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
               <p>This series consists mainly of the financial papers of those authors whose
                  correspondence was selected for item-level processing (see <emph render="bold"
                     >Processing Note and Restrictions</emph>). In addition it contains the papers
                  of a number of authors who had contracts with the Russell and Volkening Agency.
                  Since these had been stored separately by HWLA, they were placed as received in
                  this series. All of the financial papers are closed during the lifetime of the
                  authors. It should be noted that since the authors Allan Bloom, Coral Lansbury,
                  and Anne Lindbergh died before the Library acquired the Wasserman collection,
                  their financial papers are open and were not separated from the correspondence.
                  Refer to the <emph render="bold">Correspondence (Open) Subseries</emph> for access
                  to their papers.</p>

                  Internal information as well as external databases and bibliographies were used to

                  published or as researchers locate publication information not found during
                  processing, researchers should bring such information to the attention of Special

                  <p>This subseries consists of authors' published book length works. Included are
                     first American editions and paperbacks, translations, special or limited
                     editions, uncorrected bound proofs, and some seventy books with
                     acknowledgements, dedications, and/or inscriptions to Harriet Wasserman (N.B.:
                     see under Wasserman's name in the <emph render="bold">Miscellaneous (Open)
                        Subseries</emph> for photocopies of these pages). A count and brief summary
                     of editions is given after each title. The absence of this summary indicates
                     that there is a single copy of an American hardback edition with no
                     acknowledgement, dedication, or inscription. The entire subseries of about 840
                     items is open. For unbound proofs or published versions with authors'
                     handwritten corrections, see the <emph render="bold">Writings (Open)
