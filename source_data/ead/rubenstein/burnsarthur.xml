      <abstract id="aspace_ec2d56ecaff83962161165ae01292c9c">Arthur Frank Burns was an Austrian-born
        economist, policy maker, and diplomat; chair of U.S. Federal Reserve Board from 1970-1978
        and economic advisor for six U.S. presidencies. These papers cover the years 1911 through
        2005. The bulk of the material was created between 1940 and 1987 and pertains to Burns's
        career as an economic advisor, particularly to Republican administrations, as the chair of
        the Federal Reserve, and as ambassador to Germany. The collection is arranged into seven
        series: Correspondence, Honors and Awards, Journals, Personal Papers, Photographs, Print
        Materials, and Research and Teaching. Topics of interest in this collection include but are
        not limited to: the United States economic system and fiscal policies; the Federal Reserve
        Board and related committees; recessions, unemployment, and inflation; the world economy and
        finance; the U.S. presidency during the time period; the Nixon presidency in particular,
        including the Watergate affair; presidential campaigns and elections; and U.S. diplomacy.
        There is a limited amount of research and teaching material, chiefly from the 1920s-1930s.
        The most significant component of the collection is the correspondence between Arthur Burns
        and Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon, Kennedy, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and George H. W. Bush, as
        well as substantive exchanges with economists Milton Friedman and Wesley Clair Mitchell.
        There are a few letters in German, French, and Russian.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Arthur Frank Burns, economist, policy maker and diplomat, was born into an Austro-Hungarian
        Jewish family in Stanislau, Galicia (now part of Ukraine) in 1904. His family immigrated to
        the United States in 1914 and settled in New Jersey. In 1925 Burns received A.B. and A.M.
        degrees in economics from Columbia University. He worked under renowned economist Wesley
        Clair Mitchell and received his Ph.D. in economics from Columbia in 1934. Between 1926 and
        1944 he taught at Columbia and Rutgers. He was named full professor at Rutgers University in
        1943. Burns's economic thought was inspired by Keynes, yet he believed that the Keynesian
        model was simplistic and totalistic as, according to Burns, each industry had its own cycle,
        hence government intervention should be taken selectively and upon detailed statistical
        analysis. Burns joined the National Bureau of Economics as Research Associate in 1930; in
        later years he served as the Director of Research (1945-1953), President (1957-1967), and
        Chairman (1967-1968) of this institution.</p>
      <p>Burns's political involvement with the Republican Party began with his support for
        Eisenhower in the 1952 election. Burns acted as the Chairman of the Council of Advisors to
        the President (1953-1956), Chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Small Business (1956), and
        as member of U.S. Advisory Council on Social Security Financing (1957-1958).</p>
      <p>Burns was also an economic advisor to Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign and acted as the
        White House economic advisor from 1969-1970. He was appointed Chairman of the Board of
        Governors of the Federal Reserve on Jan. 31, 1970, and held the position until March 1978.
        Meanwhile, he also served as the Head of the Committee on Interest and Dividends
        (1971-1974), a committee founded as part of Nixon's Economic Stabilization Program; as the
        U.S. Alternate Governor to the International Monetary Fund (1973-1978); and as a member of
        Emergency Loan Guarantee Board (1971-1978). The Nixon administration took over an economy in
        crisis, and Burns proposed a recovery program, which in the early days seemed to be
        effective. This period and Burns's reactions to its crises are well-documented in the
        correspondence and personal journals found in this collection. Between 1977-1981 and
        1985-1987, Burns served as a distinguished scholar at the American Enterprise Institute for
        Public Policy, where he taught and wrote. In 1981, Ronald Reagan appointed him U.S.
        Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany, a position he held until May 16, 1985. Burns
        passed away on June 26, 1987 in Baltimore, Maryland. Burns's theories have inspired many
        economists, including his renowned student Milton Friedman.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Arthur Frank Burns Papers cover the years 1911 through 2005. The bulk of the material
        was created from 1940 to 1987 and pertains to Burns's career as an economic advisor,
        particularly to Republican administrations, as the chair of the Federal Reserve, and as
        ambassador to Germany. The collection is arranged into seven series: <emph render="bold"
          >Correspondence, Honors and Awards, Journals, Personal Papers, Photographs, Print
          Materials</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Research and Teaching</emph>. There are also
        oversize materials housed at the end of the collection. Topics of interest in this
        collection include but are not limited to: the United States economic system and fiscal
        policies; the Federal Reserve Board and related committees; recessions, unemployment, and
        inflation; the world economy and finance; the U.S. presidency during the time period; the
        Nixon presidency in particular, including the Watergate affair; presidential campaigns and
        elections; and diplomacy. There is a small amount of research and teaching material, chiefly
        from the 1920s-1930s. The most significant component of the collection is the correspondence
        between Arthur Burns and Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon, Kennedy, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and
        George H. W. Bush, as well as substantial exchanges with economists Milton Friedman and
        Wesley Clair Mitchell.</p>
      <p>The most substantial and notable papers are found in the <emph render="bold">Correspondence
          Series</emph>, which contains letters and memoranda written from 1911-1997 both to and
        from Burns and/or his wife, Helen. The series is organized into three subseries, <emph
          render="bold">Correspondence by Individual, Correspondence by Topic</emph>, and <emph
          render="bold">Correspondence to Mrs. Helen Burns</emph>. The majority of the exchanges in
        the first subseries are letters written to or by presidents or vice presidents (Dwight
        Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush,
        Spiro Agnew, Hubert Humphrey, and Nelson Rockefeller). Burns's correspondence with
        presidents Eisenhower and Nixon is particularly extensive and reveals the making of crucial
        policy decisions. Also included is Burns's correspondence with economists Wesley Clair
        Mitchell, Milton Friedman, and George Stigler. This subseries is organized alphabetically by
        correspondent and then chronologically.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Topic</emph> subseries contains letters and
        attachments primarily related to Burns's work in academia, politics, and the private sector.
        Finally, the <emph render="bold">Correspondence to Mrs. Helen Burns</emph> subseries
        contains letters written by prominent figures such as Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and
        Mamie Eisenhower to Burns's wife, Helen, both during his life and after his death.</p>
      <p>High-value correspondence, including originals signed by presidents and some other notable
        correspondents, are separately stored and restricted to use except under direct staff
        supervision. Photocopies of these original manuscripts have been made for researcher use.
        Other letters signed by mechanical means have not been photocopied, but they are filed with
        the photocopies of original letters. </p>
      <p>The other series house papers and memorabilia documenting Burns' career, including
        photocopies of two handwritten journals (1969-1974) kept by Burns during the Nixon
        Administration; several folders of early research and teaching materials; honors and awards
        received by Burns; personal correspondence, clippings, and other materials; lectures,
        speeches, and articles from Burns's career as economist and ambassador; photographs of
        Burns, his wife Helen, and political figures and celebrities attending events; publicity
        items such as news clippings, interviews, and articles about Burns; and program materials
        for the Arthur F. Burns Fellowship, an exchange program for German and U.S. media
        professionals. Further description available at the series level in this collection
        guide.</p>
      <p>The great majority of the Burns papers are in English, but there are roughly ten items in
        German and a few items in French and Russian (Cyrillic script).</p>

          <p>The correspondence is organized into three subseries. The <emph render="bold"
              >Correspondence by Individual Subseries</emph> contains correspondence and memoranda
            between Burns and presidents, vice-presidents, politicians, and prominent economists.
            The <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Topic</emph> subseries contains letters and
            attachments primarily related to Burns' work in academia, politics, and the private
            sector. Finally, the <emph render="bold">Correspondence to Mrs. Helen Burns</emph>
            subseries contains letters written by figures such as Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and
            Mamie Eisenhower to Burns's wife, Helen, both during his life and after his death. </p>
          <p>Although high-value correspondence can be accessed in several formats, the papers
            housed in boxes 1-3 are the only complete record of exchanges. These boxes contain
            photocopies of high-value correspondence along with their original attachments,
            originals of other correspondence (including originals signed by mechanical means), and
            original onion-skin paper copies of Burns's out-going correspondence. Originals of
            high-value correspondence, without the corresponding attachments, are housed separately
            in boxes 13 and 15, and are closed to use. </p>

            <p>Organized alphabetically by correspondent and then chronologically, the bulk of this
              subseries documents Burns's work with several presidential administrations.
              Correspondents include Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Jimmy
              Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Spiro Agnew, Nelson Rockefeller, and Hubert
              Humphrey. The subseries also includes correspondence with his mentor, Wesley Clair
              Mitchell, and with his students, economists Milton Friedman and George Stigler.
              Burns's correspondence with presidents Eisenhower and Nixon constitute the most
              significant part of the subseries. These exchanges cover domestic economic matters
              such as recession, monetary and fiscal policies to regulate inflation and
              unemployment; international political and economic matters; and domestic political
              issues such as elections and party politics.</p>

              <p>Burns continued to be the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
                Board during the first year of the Carter administration. This correspondence
                documents Dr. Burns's work with the new administration especially on the matter of
                tax reform, along with budgetary issues and policies regarding OPEC. Burns presented
                his resignation to Jimmy Carter in January 1978. Included in the collection is a
                January 13, 1978 letter in which Carter accepts Burns's and expresses his
                appreciation of Burns's leadership of the Federal Reserve over the past eight years.
                The letters after January 1978 address non-economic issues such as Burns's receipt
                of the America's Democratic Legacy Award of the Anti-Defamation League and Carter's
                appreciation of Burns's support for his efforts in human rights. Two letters from
                Rosalynn Carter are also included.</p>

              <p>Burns acted as the Chairman of the Council of Advisors to the President
                (1953-1956), Chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Small Business (1956), and a
                member of U.S. Advisory Council on Social Security Financing (1957-1958) during the
                Eisenhower Administration. He played an especially crucial role in steering the
                implementation of anti-recession policies. Even after he resigned from the Council
                of Economic Advisors, he continued to counsel the president on economic matters.</p>
              <p>Topics in the correspondence include economic issues such as how to combat
                recession/depression and inflation, unemployment, budget planning, taxes, government
                expenditure, monetary policy, value of the dollar, and gold reserves. The letters
                also address U.S. domestic politics and international relations, such as the
                situation in Vietnam and Cuba and the Mutual Security Program. Burns's
                correspondence with Eisenhower continued after his term as the President ended in
                1961; the topic of the correspondence shifts to personal notes and exchanges on
                general economic models and policies, evaluation of the Eisenhower period economic
                policies and assessment, and expresses criticism of economic, political and foreign
                policies of the administrations of the time.</p>

                  <p>From Eisenhower's Deputy Assistant Bryce N. Harlow to Burns. Attached: Message
                    dictated by Eisenhower to his Deputy Assistant and sent without signature to
                    Burns because of urgency, 1960 May 14. Eisenhower states concerns about how a
                    possible hindrance regarding the budget allowed to the "Mutual Security Program"
                    would threaten defense alliance structures such as NATO and SEASO.</p>

              <p>Burns continued to be the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
                Board during the Ford Administration. Ford's correspondence to Burns primarily
                consists of routine notes of appreciation for Burns's work, for having sent
                materials, for his comments on economic matters, and for his donation to the Ford
                Library. Also included are invitations, congratulations, and notes of regret.
                Burns's side of the correspondence expresses ideas regarding economic matters such
                as the ongoing recession, Federal Reserve policies, and the Financial Reform
                Act.</p>

              <p>Contains correspondence with Mitchell, an American economist famous for his
                empirical work on business cycles and for leading the NBER in its first decades, and
                his wife, Lucy Sprague Mitchell. Great attention is paid by Burns and Mitchell to
                revising each other's drafts and economic theories. Also included are articles by
                Mitchell, his obituary, eulogies, and correspondence regarding the dedication of a
                collection in his honor. Other letters authored by Mitchell can be found in the
                academic career and National Bureau of Economic Research folders - both in the
                Correspondence by Topic Subseries.</p>

              <p>Arthur Burns was the economic advisor to Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign and
                acted as Counselor to the President (1969) for a year after the election. He was
                appointed Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve in February
                1970. The Nixon-Burns correspondence sheds light on the controversial years of
                Nixon's presidency and illustrates disagreements within the government regarding
                monetary policy, Burns' resistance to the politicization of the Federal Reserve, and
                his complaints about the White House staff. Burns' personal journals, also part of
                this collection, provide important and complimentary insights to the issues
                addressed in the Burns-Nixon correspondence.</p>

                <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
                <p>The correspondence from Arthur Frank Burns to Nixon covers the period during
                  which Dr. Burns acted as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and is comprised of
                  letters and memoranda sent to the president. Major issues addressed in the
                  correspondence are economic measures to be taken in order to fight inflation and
                  recession, the monetary policy that the Federal Reserve should pursue in
                  accordance with the Economic Stabilization Act, the issue of wage and price
                  controls, the gold crisis, the value of the dollar, and policies that the
                  administration should implement concerning the international monetary
                  situation.</p>
                <p>The letters provide important insights into the disagreements between the Nixon
                  Administration and Chairman Burns with regards to the issues of money supply, the
                  extent and strictness of wage and price controls, and international monetary
                  policy. The letters also address political matters such as Burns' opinions about
                  domestic politics, his complaints about some White House staff, and the Watergate
                  Scandal. International economic and political matters such as the Vietnam War, the
                  policy of détente with the Soviet Union, and US relations with Latin American
                  countries are also mentioned in the correspondence. Burns's handwritten journals,
                  1969-1974, found in the Journals Series in this collection, compliment this set of
                  correspondence.</p>

                  <p>[STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL] Burns's comments on the ongoing international crisis,
                    suggesting that if the US has to suspend gold sales and purchases, it make it
                    appear as if the US government was forced to do so by other governments'
                    actions; otherwise, he argues, the US would have a weaker bargaining position in
                    post-suspension negotiations. He also advises the government to "pay out gold
                    and other reserves in substantial amounts," before a suspension.</p>

              <p>Burns was U.S. Ambassador to Germany in the first Reagan administration;
                accordingly, some letters concern German-American relations. Most, however, are

          <p>Contains photocopies of two notebooks handwritten by Arthur Burns between January 20,
            1969 and July 25, 1974, when Burns was acting as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve
            during the Nixon Administration. The journals are comprised of 235 pages, are
            chronologically ordered in seven folders, and are accompanied by transcripts. They
            provide invaluable insights into the economic concerns and policies of the period as
            well as the personal and professional relations among Burns and the White House staff,
            Cabinet members, and the President. Burns describes at length his interactions with and
            personal opinions about prominent political figures of the time such as Richard M.
            Nixon, John Connally, H. Robert Haldeman, John D. Ehrlichman, John N. Mitchell, Spiro
            Agnew, Henry Kissinger, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and George Shultz, among many others.
            The journals record Burns' changing opinions about President Nixon, including
            disagreements between Burns and the White House concerning issues such as monetary
            policy and wage and price controls, the Federal Reserve, and relations with
            international economic partners. Burns' writings also provide important insights into
            his and others' opinions regarding Watergate and the White House's response to it. Other
            topics include employment and presidential appointments. There are also entries that
            discuss the all-volunteer army, busing, community action programs, congressional
            testimony, energy, food stamps, the Headstart Program, housing, Job Corps, mass transit,
            malnutrition, model cities program, oil imports, revenue sharing, urban policy, welfare
            reform, and the Soviet immigration of Jews. There are often long time lapses between
            consecutive entries; however, Burns addresses the major developments during the time he
            did not write.</p>
          <p>The journals in this collection are photocopied from originals housed at the Ford
            Library. Since Burns' handwriting is difficult to read, Ford Library staff created
            transcripts which were then edited by Arthur F. Burns' former secretary, Gail Veenstra.
            Each photocopied page is accompanied by a transcript. Some words still remain illegible
            and are identified with brackets; any additional editing by Duke Library Staff is in
            pencil.</p>
