         <abstract id="aspace_9c61accea622dcaaad80f1b15cd39660">John Buck was an American, most
            likely a resident of the New York metropolitan area. The collection consists of a diary
            in four volumes that chronicles the vacation in Great Britain of a young American named
            John Buck from August 10 to September 25, 1887. The volumes comprise 249 handwritten
            pages in total, with commercial prints, menus, receipts, and theater playbills attached
            to the back of selected pages. The script is elaborate, but legible, and the narrative
            is remarkably descriptive. Humorous sketches illustrate the first volume in particular
            and the third volume includes three photographs of the author. The diary provides a
            detailed account of Buck's voyage on the R.M.S. Britannic and his time in London, where
            he spent the majority of his vacation socializing and attending the theater. Buck also
            stayed in Edinburgh, Scotland, with Henry Irving, the famous actor and manager of the
            Lyceum Theatre, and with the Duke and Duchess of Beaufort at Badminton House.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection consists of a diary in four volumes that chronicles the vacation in Great
            Britain of a young American named John Buck from August 10 to September 25, 1887. The
            volumes comprise 249 handwritten pages in total, with commercial prints, menus,
            receipts, and theater playbills attached to the back of selected pages. The script is
            elaborate, but legible, and the narrative is remarkably descriptive. Humorous sketches
            illustrate the first volume in particular and the third volume includes three
            photographs of the author.</p>
         <p>Buck began his diary, which he entitled <emph render="doublequote">Eight Weeks Vacation
               and How I spent it,</emph> with a detailed account of the people and activities on
            board the R.M.S. Britannic while on route from New York City to Liverpool, England. Upon
            landing, he traveled to London, where he spent the majority of his vacation. Although he
            visited tourist destinations such as London Tower and Winsor Castle, Buck professed
            little interest in sightseeing and clearly preferred the social life, including
            attending dinner parties, meeting pretty young women, playing sports such as pool,
            baseball, and tennis, and above all, attending and discussing the theater. Initially,
            Buck socialized with an actor he met aboard the Britannic, W. A. Faversham, and the
            noted basso profundo, Franz Vetta, whom he met in London. From August 30 to September 4,
            Buck stayed in Edinburgh, Scotland, as the guest of Henry Irving, the famous actor and
            manager of the Lyceum Theatre. He spent these days in the company of Mr. Irving, Bram
            Stoker, the actress Ellen Terry, and her son, Teddy Craig. Buck frequently noted Mr.
            Irving's thoughtfulness and recounted their activities and conversations, including one
            humorous anecdote about <title type="simple" render="italic">Buffalo Bill's Wild West
               Show</title>. From September 5 to September 9, Buck stayed with the Duke and Duchess
            of Beaufort at Badminton House. Buck described the house and grounds, formal dinner
            parties, informal breakfasts, sporting activities, and sightseeing excursions to
            Gloucester Cathedral and Raglan Castle. The remainder of the vacation was spent in
            London, much as it began, visiting acquaintances and going to the theater until
            September 20 when he departed for Liverpool and the return voyage on the Britannic. Buck
            ceased recording events mid-Atlantic due to his sudden interest in a female
            passenger.</p>
