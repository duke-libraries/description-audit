        papers include letters, writings, financial records, a few legal documents and one
        educational record. Benjamin Rush's personal and professional outgoing letters, with some
        incoming letters, cover a wide variety of topics, but focus primarily on medical concerns,
        particularly the 1793 and other yellow fever epidemics in Philadelphia, as well as mental
        illness and its treatment, and the medical department of the Continental Army. There are a
        few letters from others to Julia Stockton Rush that seek to continue ties with her and the
        Rush family or offer condolences following Benjamin's death. Collection also contains a
        medical case book and a fragment of an essay or lecture written by Benjamin Rush, along with
        his travel diary for a trip to meet with the Board of Trustees for Dickinson College in
        178[4]; other writings include Julia Rush's devotional journal and exercise book. The
        financial records include a few statements and receipts, but primarily contain two account
        books, one maintained by Benjamin Rush, the other by Rush with his wife. These account books
        provide a complete picture of the family finances from the period before the couple married,
        almost to Julia's death. Legal documents include a sworn statement and a land patent, and
        there is an educational record for one of Rush's students. </abstract>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>The majority of the 136 letters in the series were composed by Benjamin Rush, and
            letters he wrote to Julia during the 1793 yellow fever epidemic in Philadelphia form a
            substantial part of the series. Main topics in the letters include Rush family matters,
            medical treatments for a wide variety of medical issues, American politics, and the
            country's relations with European nations. Other topics include mental illness and its
            treatment, the medical department in the Continental Army, the impact of epidemics upon
            commerce internationally, reading habits, parenting, and capital punishment. </p>
          <p>Among the prominent correspondents who wrote one or more personal or professional
            letters to Rush or his wife are Abigail Adams, John Quincy Adams, Thomas Jefferson,
            James Madison, Thomas Paine, and George Washington. Letters from others to Julia Rush
            seek to continue ties with her and the Rush family, and offer condolences following
            Benjamin's death. Included are several manuscript copies Benjamin Rush made of
            individual letters he penned.</p>

            <p>Rush states that he is never indifferent to any thing relating to America, and that
              the basis for America's freedom is broad, but is in danger from a tedious and
              expensive war, and from "the ignorance, indolence, and avarice of too many of our
              Whigs." He follows with questions regarding the country's finances, then notes that he
              has ordered a court-martial of Dr. Shippen, for whom he will serve as prosecutor. A
              postscript discusses two bills before Congress.</p>

            <p>Rush rejoices in Read's recovery and safe return to South Carolina and sends
              greetings to Read's family. He outlines family news, including that Julia has given

              humanize their friend, Dr. Ramsay, in preparation for his finding a wife.</p>

            <p>A copy, in an unknown hand, of a letter from Rush to Bayard regarding sentiments
              expressed in an earlier letter to General John Armstrong. The letter reflects
              post-revolutionary state politics in Pennsylvania. In the letter, Rush censures his
              fellow Presbyterians, who refuse to revoke the test laws and to admit amendments to
              the state constitution. He also condemns the taking over by the Presbyterian dominated
              state government of the charter of the College of Philadelphia, now the University of
              Pennsylvania, and refers to the College of Carlisle, or Dickinson College, established
              in protest to the first action. He regrets the inflammatory remarks and publications
              made by members of the state's single legislative body, the Council of Censors, and by
              Joseph Reed and Mr. Smiley, and deplores the character of Henry Osborn and Owen
              Faris.</p>

            <p>Rush writes that he wishes to share his reading of Paley's moral philosophy with her,
              because he would enjoy it more that way and it would better qualify her to educate
              their children. He describes a gathering where he provided beer to a group of
              laborers, and how affectionate one of them was to his dog, including a reflection of
              "infinite love which follows the human species." He then comments that their leaving a

              expressed wishes. Rush believes John's character is not the correct one for gun
              ownership, because he lacks gentleness and compassion. Rush requests that Julia not
              override his dissent, and strengthen their parenting as a result. He announces that he
              has taken their son Richard to see patients. He is reading John Newton's Cardiphonia.

              suffering. He then describes how he visited a patient who was having a fit of colic,

            <p>Rush updates Julia on the alarming spread of the fever. He reports that the College
              of Physicians has met to consult on how to stop the spread of disease and to draw up
              instructions for that purpose. These directions will be handed to the mayor. He asks
              her to stay in New Jersey with the children, and to pray for his protection, although
              he takes all precautions possible. He plans to confine his boys to the house for their
              protection.</p>

            <p>Rush states that the boys are so apprehensive about contracting the fever from his
              clothes that he has decided to send them to Trenton. He asks her to have them read
              something useful, because he is worried about possible habits of idleness. He notes
              that the directions from the College of Physicians are to be published tomorrow, but
              worries that the fever will not subside before October's heavy rains and frost. His
              postscript provides instructions on how to protect the boys.</p>

            <p>Rush describes the funerals taking place in the city, and tells Julia that the fever
              has been particularly fatal to the young. He rejoices that the boys left the city, but
              hopes they avoid fatigue, heat, and cold, so that they do not excite any portion of
              the fever they might have carried with them from town. He expresses concern that the
              city is only at the beginning of the epidemic, but joins Julia in planning to express
              more gratitude for God's mercies in the future.</p>

            <p>Rush briefly notes that the disease spreads, but mortality is not in proportion to
              the numbers afflicted. His cure is jalap and mercury, taken on the first day of the

            <p>Rush writes that he has seen 100 patients, and that he now saves almost all those he
              sees within the first day. He notes that some doctors rail against the cure he uses,
              several of them publishing false information, even though they generally have not
              visited patients with the fever. He chronicles the fate of several doctors that have
              contracted the disease. He notes that some of his friends are ashamed to see him once
              they fall ill. He admonishes her once more to watch the boys closely for signs of
              infection, for the fever will lie dormant 1 to 16 days following contraction.</p>

            <p>Rush notes that his cure is working, but there is a pause in new cases, and that
              fatalities are now among the poor without access to doctors or respectable people
              being treated by quacks. He states that if the fever breaks out in Princeton, he will
              send his assistant John Cox to execute his cure. Once again he documents the health
              status of his fellow physicians, although he records a rumor that some doctors have
              ceased seeing patients at all. He then discusses the various treatments that have been
              used for the fever. In a postscript, he adds that Africans in the city have proven
              immune to the disease.</p>

            <p>Rush expresses amazement that he remains uninfected by the fever, for he has seen
              over 100 patients on this date, and 40 people were buried. He states that he does not
              forget to treat the poor "remembering my dream in the Autumn of 1780." Many doctors
              have adopted his treatment, but several oppose it, as they oppose his treatment for
              lockjaw. He remarks that more of the French exiles have come down with the fever. He
              is now using bloodletting as a tool, since the weather is cooler.</p>

            <p>Rush notes that the fever has been said to become more mild, but that is not the
              case, especially if his treatment has not been used. He adds that besides combatting
              the fever, he has to contend with the "prejudices, fears, &amp; falsehoods" of his
              fellow physicians. He adds that all are tinged with infection, now. Even his own eyes
              are tinged a yellow color.</p>

            <p>Rush announces that he is well, but has a sore throat from his treatment. He saw 25
              patients by carriage; then 25 more, mostly poor people, at home, but was still forced
              to turn away 38 others. Their house continues as a hospital. He says that his
              professional detractors are increasing their persecution of him.</p>

              committee men who sought to help the poor have now died. He hopes for a change in the

            <p>Rush states that he would rejoice at news of the birth of his niece if he could, but
              he feels as though he will never feel joy again. The mortality this day is worse than
              ever. He believes it is now unsafe for her to receive articles of clothing from their
              house. Also, he would prefer to borrow money from her brother than from a bank at the
              moment.</p>

            <p>Rush lists those in the neighborhood who were not his patients that have died. He
              praises their "black friend," Marcus, for faithfully waiting on him. He has received
              letters from Europe, among them a letter from Granville Sharp, authorizing him to draw
              on contributions in London for the African Church of Philadelphia. Among the
              contributors was the Duke of Grafton. Rush points out that no doctors have inquired
              after his health, and that their confederacy against him in stronger than ever. The
              letter's signature has been excised.</p>

            <p>Rush announces that Dr. Sproat has died, adding, "It is truly distressing to think of
              the desolation which has followed the footsteps of this man, and of all the Doctors
              who use Bark- Wine- Laudanum, and hot, or cold Baths in this disorder. It is much more
              inflammatory than a common Pleurisy, &amp; who ever thought of using those remedies in
              that disease?" He notes the health of other doctors, and reports that he is now
              employed again by Mr. Hammond, who had been persuaded against Rush's treatment. He
              ends noting that Julia's sister has written to urge him to leave the city, a move he
              feels would be "unwise, and perhaps sinful."</p>

            <p>Rush writes most likely to Dr. Basil G. Middleton, (c. 1740-1818), a former surgeon
              with Virginia forces in the Revolutionary War, now living in London. Rush discusses
              personal and medical matters, touching on College of Philadelphia medical school
              classes and enrollment, and comments on the unconcluded treaty with England and the
              American political system.</p>

            <p>Rush announces that yellow fever has broken out throughout the city, but there have
              been no measures yet to exterminate the disease. Their son Richard plans to move a
              mattress and books to their farm. Rush notes that a Mr. Thomas has left Philadelphia
              forever as a result of his debts, and has ruined many young men in the meantime. In a
              postscript, Rush points out that Capt. Mitchell of the American Army has the fever.
              Rush is considering leaving and is urging his patients to leave. Rush's signature has
              been excised.</p>

            <p>Rush notes that the fever has increased more in one week than it had in three weeks
              in 1793 and 1797. He had made plans to leave in 7-10 days when the U. S. Mint was
              closed, but by the end of the letter announces more immediate plans to remove to
              Sydenham, which has been prepared for the family and servants. Their son John is
              arriving via his ship in New Castle. A note was appended to the letter in 1848, saying
              that the close of the letter was cut out for an autograph seeker.</p>

            <p>Rush notes that his pupil is better, and that he is using profuse sweating as part of
              his treatment for the fever. A later note was appended to the letter stating that Mrs.
              Rush allowed the signature to be cut away for an autograph.</p>

            <p>Rush reports that despite being exposed to the fever daily for two months, he is
              still healthy. However, he has "felt, mourned, and wept" until he could no longer do
              so. He reports that poor people chase him down in the street, and that he carries
              medicine with him in order to do all he can to help them. Free blacks and servants
              form a large percentage of his patients.</p>

            <p>Rush relates how he misses Julia, then describes the activities of their boys. He
              notes that the weather has been uncommonly cool, which has damaged crops. There has
              also been an outbreak of yellow fever in the city, but he expects it to be checked by
              the cool weather. He points out that the "ejection of Mr. Erskine's convention with
              our government by the British Court" has caused outrage in the city.</p>

            <p>The diary records Rush's travel, accompanied by a servant and via horses, between the
              outskirts of Philadelphia and Carlisle, Pennsylvania, for an initial meeting with the
              trustees of Dickinson College. During the meeting the Trustees selected Dr. Charles
              Nisbet to serve as the College's first president. Rush described the taverns and other
              travel lodges at which he stopped, along with Tavern staff and other patrons, the
              quality of the food and drink, along with conversations he witnessed or took part in.
              Discussion often centered on the topics of the Constitution, paper money, as well as
              Dickinson College. Rush also described the results of a rapid Spring thaw on the
              Susquehanna River, the unusually cold weather, the scenery, and the presence whiskey
              stills in Irish settlements and their impact on their communities.</p>

              also outlined her feelings regarding family matters, especially in regard to her
              bereavement following her husband's death. She requested intersession for family
              members, such as when her daughters emigrated to England and Canada and their later
              return, when they suffered serious illnesses, and blessings for the christenings of

            <head>Scope and Contents</head>
            <p>Contains primarily Benjamin Rush's records of his expenses, including tax and bond
              payments, rental property fees, classes and dance lessons for family members, as well
              as money lent or advanced, accounts paid, cash received, and income from boarders.
              Rush noted the wide variety of areas where his money was spent, from postage and
              travel, to clothing and shoes, to household provisions and stores, along with
              medicines purchased. In addition, Rush created accounts for servants when they
              arrived, and noted their wages and any increased wages, advances, or loans; cloth,
              clothing, and shoes provided; with occasional notes on their personal and work habits
              and work history, and when they exited his service or married. Several of the comments
              have been redacted, along with a few pages of the account book. Finally, Rush made a
              few brief commonplace notes randomly in the volume, providing a "style sheet" for
              description of pulses, outlining a few prescriptions for patients, describing the
              weather, listing inventories of his furniture and linens, recording a few recipes, and
              in 1783, noting the news of possible peace with England.</p>

            <p>Contains primarily accounts for individuals the Rush's employed in their household,
              including various house servants, cooks, coachmen, farmers and gardeners, along with
              accounts for work completed by washerwomen outside the residence. Individual accounts
              include the servant's name, followed by notes on pay and payments made, as well as any
              holds on pay, advances, loans, and pay rate increases. They also indicated when an
              individual was supplied with shoes or clothing, or had time off to visit the country.
              In addition, for the majority of the individuals, Benjamin continued his habit of
              adding a descriptive note when the person left their service, stating the reason for
              the departure, commenting on the quality of that servant's work, outlining their
              personal and work habits (especially their drinking habits), whether they married or
              not, and their race or ethnic background. Includes an incomplete alphabetical index
              for servant names. There are a few additional household accounts briefly noted, for
              wood and an umbrella, as well as two receipts, one for taxes and another (laid-in) for
              bread.</p>
