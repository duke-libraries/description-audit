         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Terry Sanford Papers document Sanford's career as a United States Senator from North
            Carolina from 1986 to 1992. The collection contains papers dated from 1926-1992, with
            the bulk of the material dated between 1986 and 1992. His senatorial campaigns, views on
            issues, interactions with constituents, and activities in committees of which he was a
            member are documented throughout the collection. Sanford served on the following U. S.
            Senate committees: Select Committee on Ethics (Chair); Special Committee on Aging;
            Budget; Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, including the Subcommittee on International
            Finance and Monetary Policy and Subcommittee on Securities; and Foreign Relations,
            including Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs (Chair), Subcommittee on
            African Affairs, and Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere and Peace Corps Affairs.</p>
         <p>Senator Sanford's 1986 and 1992 campaigns are portrayed in the Press Files Series,
            particularly in the Videos Subseries and the Speeches Subseries. The Personal/Political
            Series contains Sanford's personal files from these campaigns. His views on the topics
            of education, health care, civil rights, foreign relations, and the environment are also
            documented in the Videos Subseries in interviews with Sanford and in campaign
            commercials; in the Speeches Subseries as well as in the Press Issues Subseries of the
            Press Files Series, and in the Voting Record Subseries of the Legislative Files
            Series.</p>
         <p>Records of Sanford's activities on the committees on which he served (Banking, Housing,
            and Urban Affairs; Foreign Relations; Budget; Select Committee on Ethics; Environment;
            and Appropriations) appear in the Legislative Files Series. His ideas and actions on the
            issues addressed by these committees are reflected in the General Correspondence
            Subseries of the Personal/Political Series.</p>
         <p>Relationships with Sanford's constituents are documented in the Constituent Services
            Series. Both letters from constituents to Sanford and samples of standard form replies
            are included. Individual correspondence between Sanford and representatives of
            corporations and foundations are arranged alphabetically by the subject in the General
            Correspondence Subseries of the Personal/Political Series. The Videos Subseries of the
            Press Files Series includes lobbying material from industries.</p>
         <p>Material in the Personal Journals Subseries of the Personal/Political Series is closed
            to patron use during Sanford's lifetime unless written approval from Sanford or his
            authorized representative has been acquired.</p>
         <p>Several other area repositories hold collections pertaining to Senator Sanford's life
            and career. The Duke University Archives has records pertaining to Sanford's Presidency
            of Duke. Papers relating to his governorship are in the North Carolina Archives. His
            personal papers are among the holdings of the Wilson Library at the University of North
            Carolina.</p>
         <p>Addition (1998-0323) is chiefly comprised of correspondence and printed material related
            to Sanford's political career, involvement in community, and membership in various
            organizations. They include files regarding the 517th Infantry (chiefly newsletters), a
            Battle of the Bulge reunion (1990), Central American affairs, and "miscellaneous
            memberships". Computer diskettes of Sanford's Senate journal document his career in the
            US Senate. (1982-1991) (780 items) (1.5 linear feet)</p>
         <p>Addition (1999-0353) includes photographs and negatives of Sanford produced in 1987 for
            a senatorial portrait. (1987) (60 items) (.05 linear feet)</p>
         <p>Addition (2000-0408) comprises 51 volumes of Sanford's Senate journal that cover June
            1987 to August 1991; partial copies of his Senate schedules and 17 related micro-audio
            cassette tapes from July 1991 to March 1992; and other miscellaneous material concerning
            his senatorial campaigns of 1986 and 1992 and service in the Senate. This material was
            acquired from Sanford by Howard Covington and Marion Ellis for their use in writing
