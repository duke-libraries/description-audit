         <head>Biographical and Historical Note</head>
         <p>Alvin Roth was born on Dec. 18, 1951. He graduated from Columbia University in 1971, and
            earned a masters (1973) and Ph.D. (1974) from Stanford University in operations
            research. Roth went on to teach economics and business administration at the University
            of Illinois from 1974-1982, and at the University of Pittsburgh from 1982-1998. In 1998,
            he became full faculty at Harvard University, and remains there today. </p>
         <p>Roth's work focuses on game theory, market design, and experimental economics. He has
            worked on a variety of real-world projects, including the National Resident Matching
            Program (NRMP) system, responsible for matching medical residents with respective
            programs; the New York City and Boston public school systems' high school assignment
            selection methods; and the New England Program for kidney exchanges between incompatible
            partners. He is a Guggenheim Fellow (1983-1984), an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow
            (1984-1986), and a fellow at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has won the
            Texas Instruments' Foundation Founders' Prize (1980) and the Operations Research Society
            of America's Lanchester Prize (1991). In 2012, he and Lloyd Shapley won the Sveriges
            Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Honor of Alfred Nobel (commonly known as the
            Nobel Prize) for their work in "the theory of stable allocations and the practice of
            market design." He has also authored numerous books and over 70 peer-reviewed journal
            articles.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection offers a wealth of information from Roth's early career at the University
            of Pittsburgh, including his research and correspondence from that period, as well as
            drafts of some of his well-cited articles and writings. Approximately one-half of the
            material lies in the <emph render="bold">Correspondence and Working Papers</emph>
            series. This portion of the collection, arranged alphabetically by correspondent,
            includes professional correspondence as well as many drafts of scholarly articles. This
            arrangement replicates Roth's original filing system, which offers insight into his
            correspondence style and methodology for economics collaboration. Notable correspondents
            include Roy Weintraub, Robert Aumann, Ido Erev, Uriel Rothblum, and many more. Also
            included are various subject files, including Winner's Curse, Matching, and
            Learning.</p>
         <p>Another notable component of the collection is Roth's <emph render="bold">Writings and
               Research</emph>, which includes both working drafts of Roth's own as well as data
            printouts and other components of his work in game theory and its real-world
            applications. These files have been grouped by article and are loosely arranged by date.
            Each article's co-writers or collaborators are noted if known.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Writings by Others</emph> series has some overlap with the
            Correspondence and Working Drafts series, but for the most part the former includes only
            the article from Roth's fellow economists, without the collaborative or feedback aspect
            present in the latter series.</p>
         <p>Roth's <emph render="bold">Teaching and Coursework </emph>series includes lecture notes
            as well as tools such as transparencies used during his economics lectures. Roth's own
            coursework at Stanford is also present, including notes, exams, syllabi, and lectures on
            topics such as microeconomics, competitive strategies, game theory, and choice
            theory.</p>
         <p>Finally, the <emph render="bold">Grant Materials</emph> series is arranged by grant
            application, with each file including application materials, correspondence, reports,
            and finances relating to the grant.</p>

               <p>Roth's files of correspondence and working papers, arranged alphabetically by last
                  name. Files largely consist of professional correspondence between Roth and fellow
                  economists around the world, and usually include copies of a working paper or
                  other scholarship. There are occasional subject files interspersed as well. Most
                  files date from the late 1970s through the early 1990s.</p>

               <p>Drafts, correspondence, and data from a selection of Roth's many journal articles.
                  Includes correspondence between Roth and his co-writers, as well as some
                  publishers' correspondence. Arranged loosely by date, although many articles span
                  several years and thus do not fit in a precise chronological order. Also included
                  at the end of the series are research and notes on game theory.</p>
