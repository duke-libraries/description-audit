      <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
      <p>The Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA) compiled and held the materials that
        became this collection of poster designs (formerly known as the Outdoor Advertising Sketch
        Library), but the card file and volumes in this collection most likely originated within the
        outdoor advertising companies represented, such as General Outdoor Advertising Co. and
        Foster and Kleiser. OAAA is the primary professional and trade association representing the
        outdoor advertising industry and was founded to promote outdoor advertising interests in the
        United States. OAAA members own and operate billboards, street furniture, transit, or other
        outdoor advertising displays. Members also include service providers to the industry, users
        of the outdoor medium, and others supporting its goals.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Outdoor Advertising Association of America Poster Designs are comprised of black and
        white poster designs (for billboard or other transit advertising), some printed on cards and
        some photographed and mounted in volumes, that document the advertising design holdings of
        several outdoor advertising companies from 1934 through the 1940s and possibly later. The
        majority of the designs in the collection are stock posters in preliminary sketch form with
        simple lines, but the collection also includes finished designs with brief information on
        exhibition and award status. Stock designs were created without actual brand names so more
        than one advertiser could use them by simply inserting their own brand name or product into
        the ad. The designs include work created or acquired by the Donaldson Lithographing Co.,
        Foster and Kleiser, General Outdoor Advertising Co., and the AD-VER-TIS-ER, Inc.</p>
      <p> These designs provide a snapshot of American consumerism during the interwar years by
        demonstrating how advertising professionals in the 1930s and 1940s represented products in
        order to entice shoppers. As well, the designs document the production of commercial art
        during this time period, in both the artistic process of creating ad artwork for billboards
        or other transit advertising space, as well as in the relationship between ad agency and
        client. Proven designs were available to the ad agency as sales tools to prospective
        clients, and these stock images could be reused, so there was less need to customize
        advertising campaigns for individual clients. The designs are organized into two series:
          <emph render="bold">Printed Poster Designs </emph>and <emph render="bold">Stock Poster
          Photograph Volumes</emph>.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Printed Poster Designs Series</emph> consists of a card file of
        designs including some more polished billboard images, all arranged into product or service
        categories. The <emph render="bold">Stock Poster Photograph Volumes Series</emph> consists
        of twelve volumes of designs, also organized by product or service type. </p>

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>Consists mainly of black and white printed cards of billboard advertising designs. Most
            images are in a preliminary stage of design completion, and many are stock designs with
            no actual brand names appearing. Some, however, are more polished, containing added
            information about placement in competitions (e.g., Annual Exhibition of Outdoor
            Advertising Art), the artist, and the outdoor advertising company that presumably
            produced the design. Foster and Kleiser and General Outdoor Advertising Co. are the two
            firms most often mentioned on cards. The company <emph render="doublequote">Sales
              Promotional Service</emph> is also found. This company may have distributed stock
            design cards to subscribers, probably outdoor advertising companies, to solicit use of
            its artwork. The cards were thus used as sales tools--some are printed on the reverse
            with information directed to clients including pricing. Some General Outdoor Advertising
            Co. cards appear to have designs stamped in blue ink. This particular group of cards was
            used in recordkeeping; they contain information about particular clients that used the
            design such as client name, pricing, contract length, salesman, and type of display.</p>
          <p>Organized by product or service type categories. Some categories overlap, and so
            certain topics appear in more than one category. A few numbered categories contain no
            cards/designs. </p>

          <p>Comprised of volumes originating from the AD-VER-TIS-ER, Inc. ( Fort Wayne, Ind.). One
            volume was produced by the Donaldson Lithographing Company of Newport, Ky. Each volume
            contains pages on which a particular numbered design (about 8" x 3.5") is pasted,
            probably bound and displayed for use with prospective clients. The designs tend to be
            more complete than line drawings but none include particular names or brands. Arranged
            by product or service.</p>
