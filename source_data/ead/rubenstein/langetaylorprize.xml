        documentary prize is awarded by Duke University's Center for Documentary Studies to a writer
        and a photographer in the early stages of a documentary project. The collection houses the
        work of seven documentary artists, all recipients of the Lange-Taylor Prize: Rob Amberg,
        Mary Berridge, Steven Cozart, Jason Eskenazi, Jim Lommasson, Dona Ann McAdams, and Daniel
        Ramos. Their portfolios total 91 color and black-and-white photographic prints, some of them
        image collages, and four oral history digital videos. The projects examine a wide variety of
        topics: the culture of boxing gyms; the effects of highway construction in the Appalachian
        mountains; the experiences of HIV-positive women; Jews in mountainous villages of
        Azerbaijan; the lives of older schizophrenics institutionalized in the U.S.; the experiences
        of Mexican immigrants and their families in Chicago; and "colorism," prejudice within one's
        own racial community based on one's skin hue, documented and relived through graphic prints
        and oral interviews. Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke
        University.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The year 2015 marked the 25th anniversary of the Dorothea Lange–Paul Taylor Prize, an award
        given by the Center for Documentary Studies. First announced a year after the Center's
        founding at Duke University, the prize was created to encourage collaboration between
        documentary writers and photographers in the tradition of the acclaimed photographer
        Dorothea Lange and writer and social scientist Paul Taylor. In 1941 Lange and Taylor
        published <title render="italic">An American Exodus</title>, a book that renders human
        experience eloquently in text and images and remains a seminal work in documentary studies.
        The Lange-Taylor Prize honors their important collaborative work.</p>
      <p>The Lange-Taylor Prize is offered to a writer and a photographer in the early stages of a
        documentary project. By encouraging such collaborative efforts, the Center for Documentary
        Studies supports the documentary process in which writers and photographers work together to
        record the human story.</p>

          <p>Mary Berridge is an author and documentary photographer based in Chapel Hill, North
            Carolina, where she is working on a book about autism and neurodiversity. She is deeply
            involved in community work to support and lobby for children with special needs.
            Berridge's photographs have been exhibited in many galleries and museums including the
            Museum of Modern Art in New York, The M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco and
            the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. <title render="italic">Time</title> magazine
            recently included her in a list of "unsung American female photographers of the past
            century".</p>
          <p>Prints from Berridge's AIDS project were exhibited in 1999 at the Duke University
            Center for Documentary Studies. For this work she was awarded the 1996 Dorothea
            Lange-Paul Taylor Prize by the Center for Documentary Studies.</p>

          <p>Series comprises four digital video files and five photographic prints from Cozart's
            body of work, <title render="doublequote">The Pass/Fail Series.</title> The color prints
            range in size from 8x12 inches to 13x25 inches and incorporate a portrait of the
            interviewee and a text excerpt from the oral interview. The four video files contain
            excerpts from interviews with individuals concerning their experiences with
            discrimination and racism within their own communities. The "Brown Paper Bag Test" is
            used as both a point of reference to begin the conversation and is also used as the
            surface to create the images. Cozart's work was awarded the 2016 Lange-Taylor Prize. </p>
          <p>From the artist's statement: "Working as both a visual artist and documentarian, I
            interview family members, friends, and acquaintances about their experiences of race,
            skin tone, hair texture, and masculinity in relation to other African Americans." A full
            statement is included in the prints folder.</p>

          <p>Collection of 48 black-and-white and color inkjet prints of images and photo collages
            by Daniel Ramos, winner of the 2018 Lange-Taylor Prize.. The project, <title
              render="doublequote">The Land of Illustrious Men,</title> examines the lives of people
            who have left their home country to pursue a different and improved life for themselves
            and for their families in the U.S. Taken in Monterrey, Mexico and in Chicago, Illinois,
            the photographs include portraits of Ramos's family members and friends in households or
            in outdoor settings, often surrounded with familiar and meaningful objects. There are
            also images of graffiti, burial sites, and other locations. A few of the collages
            include typed narrative text describing the family's migration from Mexico, and life as
            an immigrant family in Chicago. A photobook by the same name has been cataloged
            separately and can be located in the Duke Libraries catalog. </p>
          <p>From the artist's statement: " 'The Land Of Illustrious Men' is a photo-novella of my
            life as a son of working-class immigrants who came to America from Mexico in search of a
            better life. The series offers the viewer a glimpse of the personal story of each member
            of my family, and reveals the nature of their relationship to one another. I include my
            own experience - a childhood spent living between two worlds, and my decision to reject
            the blue-collar tradition that was to be my presumed legacy in order to become a
            photographer... Although my journey is personal, this project is an expression of a
            larger story about immigration, cultural identity, assimilation, and class that is
            shared and felt by many."</p>
