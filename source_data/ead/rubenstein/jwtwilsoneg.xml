         <abstract id="aspace_7dcfaed402d9a562c8ffab8555541283">The J. Walter Thompson Company
            (JWT), founded in 1864, is one of the oldest and largest enduring advertising agencies
            in the United States. Edward G. Wilson was an executive with JWT from 1930 until his
            retirement in 1971, and held the positions of General Counsel, Executive Vice-President
            and Secretary of the Company. The Edward G. Wilson Papers span the period 1906-1991 and
            includes clippings, correspondence, inter-office memoranda, reports, writings, speeches
            and personal diaries that highlight Wilson's 40 year career (1930-1971) as an executive
            with the J. Walter Thompson Company (JWT). The bulk of materials fall between 1946 and
            1971, and covers the period from Wilson's return to JWT following military service in
            World War II until his retirement. As General Counsel and head of JWT's Legal
            Department, Wilson oversaw contractual relations pertaining primarily to the sponsorship
            of radio and television programs for a number of clients--including DeBeers Consolidated
            Mines, Ltd., the Eastman Kodak Company, the Ford Motor Company, the Scott Paper Company
            and Unilever. The collection reveals JWT's relationships with radio and television
            personalities--such as Fred Allen and Edgar Bergen--and professional organizations
            including the Radio Writers Guild and the Television Writers of America. In addition,
            materials in the collection touch on the anti-communist movement and blacklisting within
            the U.S. entertainment industry of the 1950s--involving personalities such as Jean Muir
            and John Henry Faulk, among others. The collection also includes records from a number
            of JWT international offices, with heavier representation from offices in London; Bombay
            (Mumbai), India; and Johannesburg, South Africa, along with records kept by some of
            Wilson's predecessors, such as Donald Foote and Sam Meek, and the South African
            advertising executive and politician James Hamilton Russell.</abstract>

               <p>Correspondence, reports, and news clippings documenting JWT's legal activities,
                  primarily from the New York office, but other offices are also mentioned. Topics
                  include the stockholder rights, the Profit-Sharing Trust, the transfer of Stanley
                  and Helen Resor's controlling interest in the company, lawsuits that involved JWT,
                  letters of terms for individual clients, compensation and contract disputes with
                  radio and television personalities and their programs, contract negotiations with
                  the Radio Writers Guild and the Television Writers of America, and lists of actors
                  and actresses approved to work during the period of Hollywood blacklisting.
                  Lawsuits represented in the series include <emph render="italic">Sartoris and
                     Laemmar vs. JWT</emph>, in which the former charged the company for forcing
                  them to sell back their stock in 1964. Another lawsuit related to the company's
                     <emph render="doublequote">going public</emph> is that of <emph render="italic"
                     >Jardine vs. JWT</emph>. Both suits provide information about Thompson's
                  efforts to provide incentives to senior management and to finance operations.</p>
               <p>The letters of terms for individual clients contain copies of client agreements
                  and often include internal memoranda, correspondence with the client, Dun &amp;
                  Bradstreet reports, financial statements, and press clippings announcing the
                  acquisition or loss of the account. Major clients represented in the series
                  include the Eisenhower-Nixon presidential campaign of 1952, Ford, the
                  Johns-Manville Corporation, Kellogg, Lever Brothers and Sylvania. Radio and
                  television personalities and programs represented in the series include Fred Allen
                  (1947-1948 only), Edgar Bergen (Charlie McCarthy), the <title type="simple"

                  Oriental-International Films, James Melton and Ford Motor Company TV
                  advertisements. The Fred Allen materials include clippings that describe the

                  as Allen's reaction to the popularity of the <emph render="doublequote"

                  blacklisting and libel actions that challenged accusations of communist

               <p>Reports, correspondence, articles, speeches, company statements and printed
                  materials comprising Wilson's office files. Topics include agent-client
                  relationships, employee evaluation and recruitment, regional managers' meetings,
                  and client records, especially for the Eastman Kodak Company, the Ford Motor
                  Company and the Scott Paper Company. Wilson solicited descriptions of a typical
                  day in an international office, which are included in this series. The run of
                  files for the Managers' Meetings (1959-1970) does not include the 1965 European
                  manager's meeting in Milan, Italy, during which Tom Sutton was named as Wilson's
                  successor as head of international operations. Arranged alphabetically.</p>
