         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Southeast Women's Employment Coalition Records (SWEC) span the period 1868 to 1991
            with the bulk dating from 1981 to 1990. The multiracial, regional organization was
            founded chiefly to expand employment opportunities for women in the rural South.
            Correspondence, financial records, reports, printed material, personnel files,
            photographs, audiovisual material, writings, meeting minutes, and conference papers
            comprise the majority of the collection. Well documented are the Southeast Women's
            Employment Coalition's efforts: to provide leadership training for women; to encourage
            women to apply for nontraditional jobs, for example through its Women's Opportunity in
            Road Construction (WORC) Project; to promote women's employment in the tourism industry;
            to evaluate economic, social and political trends affecting women in the South such as
            child care, comparable worth, and nontraditional jobs for women; and to establish ties
            with other organizations seeking to improve women's economic status. Administrative
            concerns relating to the Southeast Women's Employment Coalition, including personnel,
            financial, and organizational issues are also well described. Represented extensively
            are their efforts to raise money from private foundations and businesses. Organizations
            highlighted in the collection include Public Affairs Research and Communications, Inc.
            and the Women's Technical Assistance Project. In general, information concerning these
            topics and organizations is scattered throughout the collection.</p>
         <p>Leadership training for women, for example through workshops and conferences, is
            documented by the Research Director's Files Series, Writings Series, Project Files
            Series, Conference Files Series, Printed Material Series, Office Files Series, and
            Audiovisual Series. In addition, there is information on efforts to encourage women's
            employment in highway construction and tourism through congressional hearings and
            writings in the Research Director's Files Series, General Files Series, Project Files
            Series, Highways Projects Files Series, Pictures Series, and Audiovisual Series.</p>
         <p>Papers evaluating the economic, social, and political trends affecting women in the
            South such as child care issues and salaries are found in the Research Director's Files
            Series, Office Files Series, Writings Series, General Files Series, Project Files
            Series, Highways Projects Files Series, Subject Files Series, Conference Files Series,
            Organizations Series, Printed Material Series, and Audiovisual Series. Attempts to
            establish ties with other organizations are found in the Research Director's Files
            Series, Office Files Series, Financial Papers Series, General Files Series, Proposals
            Series, Highways Projects Files Series, Conference Files Series, Organizations Series,
            and Audiovisual Series. The organizations include the Restaurant Employees Association
            of Lexington, Ky., Tradeswomen, Inc., and Women for Economic Justice.</p>
         <p>Administrative concerns relating to the Southeast Women's Employment Coalition are
            addressed by the Research Director's Files Series, Board and Staff Meetings Series,
            Office Files Series, Correspondence Series, Financial Papers Series, Personnel Files
            Series, General Files Series, Proposals Series, Project Files Series, and Audiovisual
            Series. Information pertaining to Public Affairs Research and Communications, Inc. and
            the Women's Technical Assistance Project are included in the Proposals Series, Office
            Files Series, General Files Series, Organizations Series, and the Project Files
            Series.</p>
