      <p>Charles C. <emph render="doublequote">Chick</emph> McKinney was born in 1931 in Newdale,
        N.C., and raised in Spruce Pine, N.C. Between 1950-1952, he attended the University of
        Tennessee, where he majored in Industrial Management. He received a degree in Business
        Administration from the University of North Carolina's School of Business in 1957. McKinney
        began his career in 1957 at the J.T. Howard advertising agency in Raleigh, N.C.. There, he
        served as Creative Director and member of the board. In 1968, McKinney founded the McKinney
        &amp; Silver advertising agency, and he served as President and Chief Executive Officer
        until 1990. The agency grew to one of the largest advertising agencies in the Southeastern
        U.S.</p>
      <p>McKinney received over 500 major awards from creative and advertising competitions, and
        some of his work appeared in <title type="simple" render="italic">The One Show</title>
        exhibit in New York City, the New York Advertising Club Show, the American Television
        Commercials Festival, and the <title type="simple" render="italic">Communication
          Arts</title> Show. In 1973, an <title type="simple" render="italic">Ad Daily</title> poll
        named one of the top creative people in America.</p>
      <p>In addition, McKinney also served as a judge in many advertising competitions around the
        U.S., including for the <title type="simple" render="italic">Communication Arts</title>
        competition in California. He was frequently asked to speak at business and industry group
        meetings, including for the Magazine Publishers Association. He also served as a trustee of
        the North Carolina Symphony, and was a member of the National Trust for Historic
        Preservation, the Sphinx Club, the Carolina Country Club and the Figure Eight Yacht Club,
        among others.</p>
      <p>McKinney died Sept. 12, 2007 in Raleigh, N.C.</p>

        &amp; Silver (M&amp;S) advertising agency. The collection primarily consists of
        correspondence; memoranda; clippings; presentations to clients; proofs; speeches; reports;
        McKinney's handwritten drafts of advertising campaigns; and brochures from graphic artists
        and design companies. The collection also includes films and videocassettes of advertising
        spots, slides for new business presentations, and periodicals related to advertising and
        graphic design. Companies represented in the collection include American Drew; Bacardi
        Corporation; Bahamas Tourism; Barnett Banks; Benihana; Beatrice Foods Company;

      <p> Many of the clippings and presentation drafts and fragments arrived unfoldered and
        interspersed throughout the collection. Complete presentation drafts were foldered by
        presentation title; presentation fragments and clippings were foldered as miscellaneous.
        Many of McKinney's drafts of advertising campaigns appeared in ruled notepads, often with
        clippings and additional sketched interleaved. Items attached to a particular notepad were
        foldered together and titled by subject and detached from cardboard backing. Legal sized
        notes were photocopied and reduced to letter size.</p>

            <p>Contains drafts of general agency presentations and advertisements. Bulk of materials
              include McKinney's handwritten notes in which he experimented with agency slogans and
              general campaign concepts, particularly those which became the basis for the agency's
                <emph render="doublequote">flip chart</emph> presentations. Contains extensive
              materials related to the agency's <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Anatomy of
                Selling an Idea</title> campaign, which referenced the life and work of artist
              Leonardo da Vinci. Most of the items arrived as ruled note pads, with reference
              materials and additional drafts interleaved. Perforated pages from legal pads were
              detached. Legal sized items were photocopied and reduced to letter size. Original
              order of notebook pages and interleaved items was maintained. Items were grouped into
              folders according to the notepad to which they were attached. The presentation's title
              was used as the folder title; where no title was available, the presentation's first
              words were used as folder title. Notepads containing sketches for multiple or
              unidentifiable presentations were detached, paperclipped and foldered as <emph
                render="doublequote">miscellaneous flip chart drafts</emph> or <emph
                render="doublequote">miscellaneous presentation drafts.</emph> Folders arranged
