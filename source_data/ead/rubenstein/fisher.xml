         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The papers of the lawyer and educator William Righter Fisher and the journalist Mary
            Wager Fisher consist primarily of correspondence, but also include photographs (several
            of them tintypes and cartes-de-visite), financial papers, diaries, clippings, printed
            material, and writings and speeches. Among correspondents are many journalists,
            physicians, educators, and other notable figures of the late nineteenth century
            including Lucy Abbott, Mercy Baker, Jennie Chapin, Mary L. Booth, W.S. Burke, James
            Gowdy Clark, M.E. Dodge, Weston Flint, P. Girard, S. D. Harris, Albert Leffingwell,
            Henry C. Olney, W. Trickett, George Boyer Vashon, and Frank J. Webb. The collection also
            includes letters from James B. Hazelton of the First Regiment, New York Artillery.
            Hazelton's letters describe battles and political events of the Civil War, including
            Lincoln's re-election campaign and the anti-draft riots. The papers are particularly
            rich in documentation of women in medicine and women's medical education in the second
            half of the nineteenth century; the Freedmen's schools in the Reconstruction South; the
            movement for women's rights; and friendship among American women in the late Victorian
            era.</p>
         <p>The Correspondence Series includes letters from three prominent women physicians of the
            period (Jennie Chapin, Mercy N. Baker, and Lucy M. Abbott) to Mary Wager before her
            marriage to Fisher. In their letters they described their medical education, their
            obstetrical experience, and the high cost of tuition and living expenses at the Women's
            Medical College of Philadelphia. Letters prior to her marriage in 1876 also attest to
            Wager's numerous romantic involvements. Among her admirers was lawyer and educator
            Weston Flint, and the Correspondence Series includes over 100 letters from him
            describing his political, social, and literary interests as well as his deep affection
            for Mary Wager. He also wrote about his wartime travels and his interest in helping the
            contrabands medically and educationally. Flint detailed political events of the Civil
            War, including Lincoln's re-election campaign and the anti-draft riots, and mentions the
            Copperheads. He expressed particular interest in the moral state of soldiers, decrying
            their drinking of alcohol and consorting with prostitutes. Flint sometimes included
            poetry in his letters.</p>
         <p>Also in the Correspondence Series are two letters (1870) from Frank J. Webb, the author
            of The Garies and Their Friends (1857), a daring novel about an interracial couple. In
            one of these letters dated May 5, he referred to a 500-page manuscript sent to Harper's
            for an unpublished novel, Paul Sumner, which he considered to be superior to The Garies.
            In a four-page letter to Wager (April 9, 1870), African American writer, attorney, and
            educator George Boyer Vashon provided an autobiography. The events of his life were
            penned on the letterhead of The New Era: A National Journal, Edited by Colored Men.</p>
         <p>The collection offers insight into emotionally intense friendships between women of the
            nineteenth century. Wager's female friends sent good wishes, but expressed great
            jealousy at the time of her marriage to Fisher. Young women wrote of both romantic and
            sisterly love for Mary, and sometimes discussed such issues as women's education,
            women's dress, women's suffrage, and temperance.</p>
         <p>The bulk of William Righter Fisher's letters in the collection were written between him
            and his parents. A small cache of letters from author and dean of Dickenson College Law
            School William Trickett, who lived in Germany in 1872, provide a vivid illustration of
            the political climate and structure of the Germany of Bismarck. Also to be found among
            letters to Fisher are several written in the late 1860's by agents of the Freedmen's
            Bureau and the Freedmen's school in Wytheville, Virginia. </p>
         <p>While the bulk of the collection consists of correspondence, some speeches and writings
            by Mary Wager Fisher and Weston Flint are included. Of particular interest is a
            photocopy of Mary Wager's article entitled <title type="simple" render="doublequote">
               Women as Physicians.</title> Also, the Pictures Series includes both cartes-de-visite
            and tintypes.</p>
         <p>The William Righter and Mary Wager Fisher Papers provide numerous windows through which
            researchers can view aspects of late Victorian America. The collection provides an
            unusual entree into the private and public lives of nineteenth-century men and women,
            and particularly provides information about the professionalization of American women,
            relationships between women in nineteenth-century America, and race relations in the
            Reconstruction South.</p>
