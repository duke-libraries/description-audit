         <abstract id="aspace_77d63da4b94cddeab77467c17f586263">Dorothy "Cookie" Foster Teer was
            born on August 15, 1941 to Dorothy and Nello Teer, Jr. of Durham, N.C. After a stint in
            New York, she returned to Durham in the 1970s. After taking some courses at Duke
            Divinity School, she joined the committee that founded Triangle Hospice. In the early
            1980s, Teer became an overnight radical feminist, activist, and speaker, giving over 400
            slide shows around the United States on pornography, sex role stereotyping, and child
            pornography. A 1987 conversation led to her co-founding of Southern Sisters Bookstore, a
            Durham, N.C. bookstore "by, for, and about women." By the late 1980s and 1990s, Teer was
            heavily involved in advocacy efforts around child custody, divorce, and domestic abuse,
            and frequently had "mothers on the run" living in her home. With a group of other women
            activists and radicals, Teer founded a writing collective called Women Against Sex.
            Married and divorced twice, Teer had three children. After Southern Sisters Bookstore
            closed, Teer took a step back from activism and began working as a real estate agent.
            The collection dates primarily between 1983-1997, providing thorough documentation of
            the social, cultural, and political debates over pornography in the United States in the
            1980s and 1990s, with materials from both proponents and opponents of anti-pornography
            legislation, as well as detailed documentation of the pornography industry, and
            transcripts from hearings organized by the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography.
            The collection contains some materials related to particular feminist activists and
            theorists, including Nikki Craft, Catherine MacKinnon, and Andrea Dworkin. Teer's
            extensive subject files also contain clippings, correspondence, and printed materials
            pertaining to women's rights, feminists, feminist organizations and events, and social
            issues related to women and children such as rape, pornography, incest, prostitution,
            domestic violence, child custody, and child abuse. Other materials relate to her
            ownership of the Southern Sisters bookstore (Durham, N.C.), such as promotional
            materials, newsletters, events fliers, and calendars.</abstract>

         <p>Dorothy "Cookie" Foster Teer was born on August 15, 1941 to Dorothy and Nello Teer, Jr.
            of Durham, N.C. After a stint in New York, she returned to Durham in the 1970s to go
            into business. After taking some courses at Duke Divinity School, she joined the
            committee that founded Triangle Hospice. In the early 1980s, Teer became an overnight
            radical feminist, activist, and speaker, giving over 400 slide shows around the United
            States on pornography, sex role stereotyping, and child pornography. A 1987 dinner
            conversation led to her co-founding of Southern Sisters Bookstore, a Durham, N.C.
            bookstore "by, for, and about women" that served as a haven for activism and women's
            experiences. By the late 1980s and 1990s, Teer was heavily involved in advocacy efforts
            around child custody, divorce, and domestic abuse, and frequently had "mothers on the
            run" living in her home. With a group of other women activists and radicals, Teer
            founded a writing collective called Women Against Sex; they gave a paper at a conference
            in New York with the same title, which is still printed in anthologies. Married and
            divorced twice, Teer had three children. After Southern Sisters Bookstore closed, Teer
            took a step back from activism, and began working as a real estate agent who, with a
            woman builder friend, restored and sold old houses.</p>

         <p>The materials in the Dorothy "Cookie" Teer Papers date from 1971 to 2000, with the bulk
            of the collection dating between 1983 and 1997. These materials include: newspaper
            clippings, magazines, correspondence, photographs, meeting minutes, manuscripts, notes,
            published books, audio and videotapes, organizational records, and court transcripts.
            The collection documents Teer's activism during this period, the feminist issues with
            which she was concerned, feminist and anti-pornography activism in and around Chapel
            Hill and Durham, N.C., and the activities of the organizations of which Teer was a
            member, including the National Organization for Women (N.O.W.) and Pornography
            Awareness. </p>
         <p>This collection provides thorough documentation of the social, cultural, and political
            debates over pornography in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s, with materials
            from both proponents and opponents of anti-pornography legislation, as well as detailed
            documentation of the pornography industry, with a focus on publications such as Playboy
            and Hustler. Transcripts from hearings organized by the Attorney General's Commission on
            Pornography supplement these materials, with testimony from all sides of the pornography
            debate. The collection contains some materials related to particular feminist activists
            and theorists, including Nikki Craft, Catherine MacKinnon, and Andrea Dworkin. Teer's
            extensive subject files also contain newspaper and magazine clippings, correspondence,
            and printed items pertaining to women's rights, feminists, feminist organizations and
            events, and social issues related to women and children such as rape, pornography,
            incest, prostitution, domestic violence, child custody, and child abuse. Other materials
            relate to her ownership of the Southern Sisters bookstore (Durham, N.C.), such as
            promotional materials, newsletters, events fliers, several rolodex files, rubber stamps,
            and calendars.</p>
         <p>The collection is organized into four series: Subject Files, Orange County Human
            Relations Commission, Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, and Southern Sisters
            Bookstore. </p>
         <p>The Subject Files series contains clippings and academic articles related to violence
            against women and children. Other materials include extensive documentation of the
            anti-pornography movement, the work of the Orange County Human Relations Commission, the
            National Organization for Women (N.O.W.), and various feminist or anti-pornography
            symposia. Includes files on feminist artist and activist Nikki Craft and feminist
            scholar and lawyer Catherine MacKinnon. Several files relate to the women's/feminist
            Southern Sisters Bookstore in Durham, N.C., of which Teer was a proprietor. </p>
         <p>The Orange County Human Relations Commission series contains materials related to the
            Orange County Human Relations Commission and the Committee for Justice for Women of
            Orange County. Some materials consist of pamphlets or news clippings related to the
            HRC's focus areas, especially the status of women and children within the county and the
            state; series also contains planning for and documentation of the public hearings on the
            status of women and children in Orange County, N.C., organized by the Human Relations
            Commission and held in 1989.</p>
         <p>The Attorney General's Commission on Pornography series contains materials related to
            the commission's 1985-1986 investigation into pornography. Consisting almost entirely of
            transcripts from public hearings on pornography, some with annotations, this series
            details many aspects of the U.S. pornography industry. This series also contains some
            materials from the 1983 Minneapolis hearings on pornography.</p>
         <p>The Southern Sisters Bookstore series contains materials related to the feminist/women's
            Southern Sisters Bookstore, of which Teer was co-owner, President, and CEO. Materials
            include financial records, flyers, mailing lists, mission statement, bibliographies of
            materials related to feminist issues, as well as materials such as cards from the
            bookstore's Rolodex, signs, and rubber stamps. Contains some correspondence from
            patrons, donors, and supporters of the store.</p>

               <p>This series contains materials related to the Orange County Human Relations
                  Commission as well as the Committee for Justice for Women of Orange County, both
                  of which are part of the Orange County Office of Human Rights and Relations. Teer
                  was a member of the Orange County Human Relations Commission from 1988 to 1992,
                  and co-founded the Committee for Justice for Women in 1989. Some materials consist
                  of pamphlets or news clippings related to the HRC's focus areas, especially the
                  status of women and children within the county and the state. This series also
                  contains planning for and documentation of the public hearings on the status of
                  women and children in Orange County, N.C., organized by the Human Relations
                  Commission and held in 1989.</p>

               <p>The Attorney General's Commission on Pornography Series contains materials related
                  to the commission's 1985-1986 investigation into pornography, which resulted in
                  the Meese Report. Consisting almost entirely of transcripts from public hearings
                  on pornography, some with annotations, this series details many aspects of the
                  U.S. pornography industry. This series also contains some materials from the 1983
                  Minneapolis hearings on pornography, which were part of a movement to create a
                  city-wide Anti-pornography Civil Rights Ordinance.</p>
