    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Women's Refugee Commission, originally known as the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, was founded in 1989 by Catherine O'Neill, Liv Ullmann, Susan Forbes Martin, and Susan Stark, with the support of the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Mary Anne Schwalbe served as the founding director, from 1989 to 1994. She was followed by executive directors Mary Diaz, 1994-2004, Carolyn Makinson, 2004-2010, and Sarah Costa, 2010 to the present. The organization aims "to ensure that the voices of refugee women are heard and to provide these women and their families with the best opportunities for safe, productive lives and a future without fear."</p><p>Today there are several programs within the Women's Refugee Commission, including Reproductive Health, Fuel &amp; Firewood Initiative, Livelihoods, Youth, Disabilities, Detention &amp; Asylum, and Gender. To address the needs of displaced women, children, and youth, the WRC staff works with local humanitarian groups to document best practices, propose solutions, and lobby for improvements in refugee policies and protections within the United States and at the United Nations.</p><p>For more information on the activities and history of the Women's Refugee Commission, visit their website: <extref xlink:href="http://www.womensrefugeecommission.org">www.womensrefugeecommission.org</extref> </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The collection is organized into several series, each representing different operations within the Women's Refugee Commission. </p><p>The <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials</emph> series includes tapes in a variety of formats documenting speaking engagements, luncheons, and interviews with WRC staff; raw footage of trips to refugee camps and field visits with refugees around the world; and recordings of testimony and other projects highlighting the experiences of refugee women and children. This series also includes over 5,000 photographs, slides, and negatives documenting trips to refugee camps and the activities of refugees around the world. <emph render="bold">Access is RESTRICTED</emph>: use copies are required for access.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Printed Materials and Publications</emph> series consists largely of the publications and documentation produced by the Women's Refugee Commission staff about refugee conditions in crisis situations around the world. Trip reports constitute a large portion within the series, covering visits to refugee camps in Africa, Asia, Europe, South America, and United States prisons (where asylum seekers are detained). Also included are public reports and guidelines on issues like domestic and gender-based violence; reproductive health and the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP); armed conflict and its effects on children; and fuel alternatives and strategies. Drafts of publications, newsletters from the WRC, and a small amount of drawings by refugee children make up the rest of this series.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Children, Youth, and Education</emph> series includes a variety of materials from that WRC program, including additional reports and guidelines. A large component consists of reports, meetings, and other files from the Education in Emergencies initiative.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Foundations </emph>series includes name files for various foundations, trusts, and charities who support the operations of the Women's Refugee Commission. Also included are name files for former board members and commissioners.</p><p><emph render="bold">Protection Program</emph> is a small series with materials from the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) group and meeting files from the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW).</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Reproductive Health</emph> series is a large series with several subseries, all relating to the activities of the Reproductive Health program. One such subseries is the Reproductive Health Response in Conflict (RHRC) Consortium's historical documents, which includes meeting files, conference and event materials, annual reports, and some photographs. Another subseries is United States government-funded projects, covering HIV/AIDS and gender-based violence. Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) projects, Thai-Burma border trafficking research, donor files, and subgrantee files make up the remainder of the series. The majority of the Reproductive Health series is restricted.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Media</emph> series consists of newspaper clippings and printouts regarding refugee sitations and the Women's Refugee Commission's coverage in the media.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Social Protection and Livelihoods</emph> series includes program materials and evaluations, with heavy documentation for the Age, Gender and Diversity Mainstreaming (AGDM) Initiative project and its various implementations around the world. Also included in this series are reports and research relating to the Livelihoods program, WRC general information and materials, strategic planning for the group, and board and delegation visits, meetings, and agendas.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Subject Files</emph> series includes topical files primarily related to refugee women and their organizations; issues, such internal displacement, habitat, literacy, and resettlement; the Commission's participation and protection project; and education, especially in emergencies and for girls and adolescents. Other files are related to the Commission's partners in refugee work.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Executive Director Files</emph> series includes materials from Executive Directors Mary Diaz, Carolyn Makinson, and Sarah Costa, such as summary reports and correspondence from all of the WRC programs, UN Security Council Resolutions and other WRC-related initiatives, Board of Director meeting packets, and files for individual board members, commissioners, experts, and fundraisers.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Board of Directors (BOD) Files</emph> series contains primarily board member packets and planning documents for Commission board meetings between 1997-2014. Some board member packets also contain Advocacy Day materials. There are also items related to the Excecutive and Nominating Committee meetings, as well as packets on specialized topics, such as peace initiatives and the Bureau of Public Affairs in the U.S. Department of State. There are a few files related to Board mailings, donors, and potential commissioners. </p><p><emph render="bold">D.C. Office Files</emph> are CLOSED for 20 years (until 2031) unless prior permission is received from the donor. The series includes files on Haiti, Gender, Detention and Asylum, and other programs run through the D.C. office.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">New York Office Files</emph> includes material related to the rebranding of the Commission's logo and general design issues, planning anniversary celebrations, launches for reports and book publications, and general files on communications and accountability working groups.</p><p>Acronyms frequently used in the collection: <list type="simple"><item>AGDM: Age Gender Diversity Mainstreaming</item><item>CSW: Commission on the Status of Women</item><item>EmOC: Emergency Obstetric Care</item><item>GBV: Gender-based Violence</item><item>INS: Immigration and Naturalization Service (US)</item><item>IRC: International Rescue Committee</item><item>MISP: Minimum Initial Service Package</item><item>RH: Reproductive Health</item><item>RHC: Reproductive Health in Crises</item><item>RHRC: Reproductive Health Response in Conflict Consortium</item><item>SIPA: School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University</item><item>UNFPA: United Nations Population Fund</item><item>UNHCR: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</item><item>WPS: Women, Peace, and Security</item><item>WRC: Women's Refugee Commission</item></list> </p>  </scopecontent>

Trip reports constitute a large portion within the series, covering visits to refugee camps in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America, as well as United States prisons (where asylum-seekers are detained). Also included are public reports and guidelines on issues like domestic and gender-based violence; reproductive health and the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP); armed conflict and its effects on children; and fuel alternatives and strategies. Drafts of publications, newsletters from the WRC, and a small amount of drawings by refugee children make up the rest of this series.</p><p>Box 49 of this series is from Accession 2010-0150.

DAP works to ensure that vulnerable migrants in the United States are not detained unless absolutely necessary and that their basic rights are protected and respected. DAP advocates for legislation and policy that would ensure the safety and well-being of migrant women, families and unaccompanied children. DAP works with the executive branch, the U.S. Congress and the Department of Homeland Security, including its various agencies, to institutionalize these important safeguards.</p><p>This series has been loosely sorted into six sub-series: Children, Detention and Asylum, Gender, INS, Haiti, and Other. The Children sub-series contains a wide range of material, including drafts and debates surrounding the Unaccompanied Alien Children Protection Act; files on child soldiers; and reports on refugee children. The Detention and Asylum sub-series contains the largest amount of materials, and includes files on specific detention facilities; asylum laws, policies, and reports; and advocacy and media initiatives. Gender files encompass numerous aspects of issues relating to women, including health, domestic violence, trafficking, and sexual assault. INS materials largely relate to the WRC's interactions with various INS officers and agencies, as well as conditions at various INS-run facilities. </p><p>Due to its size, the Haiti sub-series has been sorted independently from the other sub-series. It includes reports, presentations, and internal files regarding Haiti refugees in particular, including children, detention facilities, human rights conditions, legal cases, and many other subjects which could easily fall into other sub-series.</p></scopecontent><accessrestrict id="aspace_a5dbedb315ce16646a194a20be77506a"><head>Conditions Governing Access note</head><p><emph render="bold">The D.C.
