        Silk span his entire career and include correspondence files; printed material such as
        periodicals and reports; research or subject files; newspaper clippings files; drafts of
        writings, including Silk's books, New York Times news columns, editorials, speeches,
        lectures, book reviews, and essays. There are also papers and reprints by Silk's colleagues;
        organizations files; publicity and informal photographs of Silk; financial documents;
        economic data; some teaching materials such as reading lists; and theses and dissertations
        (including Silk's own thesis on Swedish post-war housing, 1947). The collection also
        contains groups of cards, notes, memos, calendars and agendas. Silk's papers are a vast and
        rich resource for learning about the intersection of politics, economics, and popular
        opinion in the 20th century, U.S. fiscal policies, global economics, and specific topics as
        unemployment, inflation, banking, Keynesian economics, markets and marketing, the economies
        of Asian countries, and many other subjects. A more detailed original paper inventory is

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Leonard Solomon Silk, a journalist of economics, was born on May 15, 1918 in Philadelphia,
        and passed away in 1995 in Montclair, New Jersey. He entered Dickinson College in
        Pennsylvania in 1936 and transferred to The University of Wisconsin on a scholarship the
        following year. There he began his journalistic career, editing the humor magazine <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Octopus</title>. He also became influenced by the
        cutting-edge economics department, and professors such as Selig Perlman. Silk entered Duke
        University in 1940 for graduate study in economics; his mentor at Duke was international
        economist Calvin Bryce Hoover. His graduate study was interrupted during World War II when
        he enlisted in the Army Air Forces. He worked as a Morse code operator in Alaska, but also
        wrote for <title type="simple" render="italic">Yank</title> and other Army publications. In
        this capacity, he covered the 1945 founding conference of the United Nations in San
        Francisco. Upon his return to graduate study in 1946, he travelled to Sweden to study the
        Swedish housing system. He published an article on this research in <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Fortune </title>magazine; a longer version of which became his Ph.D.
        thesis and subsequently his first book, <title type="simple" render="italic">Sweden Plans
          for Better Housing</title> (1948), published by Duke University Press.</p>
      <p>Silk is most well known as a columnist and editorial writer for <title type="simple"
          render="italic">The New York Times</title> and <title type="simple" render="italic"
          >Business Week</title>. He was one of the first journalists known for making complex
        economic issues understandable to the average reader. He became a full-time columnist for
          <title type="simple" render="italic">The New York Times</title> from 1976-1993 and
        published a column twice weekly in the business pages under the <title type="simple"
          render="doublequote">Economic Scene</title> rubric. In later years he also frequently
        wrote major news stories on economic issues.</p>
      <p>In addition to his journalistic work, Silk taught economics at the University of Maine,
        Simmons College in Boston, the University of Oslo, and Pace University. He was a Senior
        Research Fellow on the United Nations for the Ralph Bunche Institute at the City University
        of New York, and a Senior Fellow of the Brookings Institution. He worked for the federal
        government in various positions such as a housing expert and an economist for the United
        States Mission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).</p>
      <p>Silk expanded much of his journalistic research into books; his most well known are <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Economics in Plain English</title> (1978), <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Economics in the Real World</title> (1984), and <title
          type="simple" render="italic">The American Establishment</title>.</p>
      <p>Silk was drawn to economics by the Great Depression. During his undergraduate study at the
        University of Wisconsin, he was influenced by Keynesian theory and recently popularized
        views that economists should study micro-economics and not just macro-economics. Eventually
        Silk moved away from Keynesian theory, but advocated both government regulation and
        deregulation based on the particular economic situation. He viewed economics as a branch of
        philosophy and believed that economics should improve the quality of life for people,
        especially the disadvantaged.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The papers of Leonard Silk span his entire career, and are arranged by original accessions,
        within which there are divisions by format,assembled by Silk. Most but not all accessions
        are described in this collection guide. The largest one is numbered 6096 and comprises over
        80 large boxes.</p>
      <p>There are many format divisions, and they typically include correspondence files; printed
        material such as periodicals and reports; research or subject files; newspaper clippings
        files; drafts of writings, including Silk's books, news columns, editorials, speeches,
        lectures, book reviews, and essays; papers and reprints by Silk's colleagues; organizations
        files; publicity and informal photographs of Silk and others; financial documents; economic
        data such as forecasts and tables, much of it reported by the U.S. government; some teaching
        materials such as reading lists; and theses and dissertations (including Silk's 1947 thesis
        on Swedish housing policies). There are also groups of cards, notes, memos, calendars and
        agendas, and some minutes of meetings relating to organizations with which Silk was
        involved. </p>
      <p>Leonard Silk's papers are a vast and rich resource for learning about the intersection of
        politics, economics, and popular opinion in the 20th century. Specific topics include U.S.
        fiscal policies; global economics (starting with materials on post-World War II Europe);
        trends in social institutions in the U.S.; and other economic topics as American business,
        unemployment, inflation, banking, macroeconomics and Keynesian economics, markets and
        marketing (pharmaceutical and tobacco, among others), the economies of Asian countries such
        as Japan, and many other subjects. </p>
      <p>A more detailed original paper inventory is available in the library; in it, significant
        portions of the correspondence are listed at the item level, including correspondents'
        names; separated book titles are also listed individually. Many groups of other materials,
        however, are described only by number of pieces.</p>
      <p>In the correspondence files, many of them arranged in chronological order, the majority of
        the letters are addressed to Silk, but there are also some written by him. Significant
        correspondents include writers and journalists as well as well-known political figures and
        economists too numerous to mention. A search using key words may be helpful in locating
        particular individuals. Again, the original paper inventory contains the names of hundreds
        of individual correspondents.</p>
      <p>The largest group of materials in the collection consists of print items. Silk assembled
        extensive research files of clippings, articles, periodicals, reports, government
        publications, and reprints. All of these supported his current research interests, which
        ranged widely but chiefly focused on macroeconomics, Keynesian economic theory, economics
        for the social good, and banking and finance. He also set aside pamphlets, tables and
        charts, and even maps related to his travels.</p>

      <head>Collection Arrangement</head>
      <p>The collection has been given basic processing and is in the original order as received by
        the University of Wyoming from where it was transferred. The largest divisions represent
        additions to the Silk Papers, numbered by the University of Wyoming and dated, each of which
        is made up of format groupings such as correspondence, reports, and subject files, which
        appear randomly throughout each addition. Within those groupings there is often an original
        alphabetical order, particularly for subject files and correspondence. Keyword searching can
        be used to uncover specific topics or names in this large collection. Note that portions of
        the collection accessions are not described in this collection guide. The papers are in the
        queue to be fully processed by library staff.</p>
      <p>Gaps in the box number sequence come from print materials that were separated for the
        Perkins Library general collections, and are no longer housed with the manuscript
        collection. See the administrative sections at the beginning of this collection guide for
        more information.</p>

      <head>Separated Material</head>
      <p>At the University of Wyoming, and later, upon arrival of the collection at Duke, boxes of
        selected print material such as books and pamphlets were separated from the personal papers
        represented in this collection guide. At Duke, large groupings of print material have been
        transferred to the Perkins Library general collections or to the holdings of the David M.
        Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library. Gaps in the box number sequence reflect these
        separated boxes. The original paper finding aid lists most but not all of the books
        originally in the collection by title. Please contact Research Services in the Duke David M.
        Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library for assistance in locating materials.</p>

          <p>Throughout this addition, the largest in the collection, there are large groups of
            reprints, correspondence, reports, and other print materials. There are three divisions
            with alphabetical sub-series. The first runs through Box 50 and contains the largest
            subject files series in the collection (12 boxes). Beginning with Box 51, the
            alphabetical arrangement starts over at with Advertisements and Announcements. At Box
            108 another alphabetical arrangement begins with Charts and Documents. This last
            sub-series houses many printed materials, and includes a set of interviews of notable
            individuals conducted by Silk.</p>
          <p>There are large amounts of correspondence throughout the addition (1940s-1980s),
            equally large series of subject files, and series of memoranda (1935-1980s) exchanged
            between Silk and various individuals. Also of interest are large series of manuscripts,
            galley proofs, and other writings by Silk as well as by others; many folders of speeches
            assembled by Silk; groups of expert testimony, with statements from economists such as
            Arthur Burns; economic forecasts; a group of serial essays on economics published by the
            University of Chicago; and various publications and newsletters. There are also groups
            of photographs of Silk scattered throughout (Boxes 32, 51 and 124 especially). Finally,
            Silk's original thesis, Duke University 1947, <title type="simple" render="doublequote"
              >Social Housing Policy in Sweden,</title> is in Box 49 of this addition.</p>
          <p>Gaps in the box number sequence reflect separated print material. See the
            administrative sections at the top of this collection guide for more information. A more
            detailed original paper inventory is available in the library; in it significant
            portions of the correspondence are listed at the item level, including correspondents'
            names.</p>
