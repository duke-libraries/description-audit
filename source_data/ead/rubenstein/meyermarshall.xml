      <p>Rabbi Marshall T. Meyer was a progressive and activist rabbi who expounded a politically
        engaged Conservative Judaism. For Meyer, religion was inseparable from his politics, which
        spanned the breadth of local, national, and international arenas.</p>
      <p>Meyer received his education from Dartmouth and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America,
        where he came under the influence of Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel. After being ordained
        rabbi in 1958, Meyer and his family moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1959, where they
        were to stay until 1984. During his tenure as rabbi of Comunidad Bet El, Meyer led the
        reinvigoration and renaissance of Argentina's Jewish community. He also lived and worked
        through the political upheavals and turmoil of the 1970s and 1980s, openly speaking out
        against the human rights abuses perpetrated under the rule of the military junta, and
        visiting and attempting to secure the release of prisoners ("the disappeared") in
        clandestine jails. Meyer was instrumental in negotiating the release of Jacobo Timerman, who
        later dedicated his work, <title type="simple" render="italic">Prisoner Without a Name, Cell
          Without a Number</title> to Meyer. After the return of democracy to Argentina in 1983,
        Argentine President Raul Alfonsin recruited Meyer to serve on CONADEP (National Commission
        on the Disappearance of Persons), which led a national investigation to establish the extent
        of the abuses suffered under the military junta. </p>
      <p>Meyer returned to the United States in 1984 and took over the helm of congregation B'nai
        Jeshurun, reviving the decaying New York City synagogue and transforming it into a dynamic
        center for Judaism in the United States. Meyer advocated for intra-religious dialogue and
        peace efforts, the plight of marginalized groups within the United States, human rights
        abuses in Central America (El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala), and for peace and respect
        for human rights in Israel and Palestine.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The papers of Marshall T. Meyer span the years 1919-2004. The collection contains personal
        and professional correspondence from throughout Meyer's career as a religious leader and
        human rights activist; his published and unpublished writings and speeches; printed material
        collected by Meyer; Meyer's working and research files organized by geography,
        organizations, people, and subject; personal files, including appointment books,
        biographical material, papers from Meyer's school days, photographs, memorabilia, and
        material documenting his numerous engagements; audio tapes and cassettes of Meyer's
        services, interviews, lectures, and other events; and Betacam and VHS videocassette
        recordings of interviews and other public appearances by Meyer. </p>
      <p>The collection contains extensive evidence of Meyer's activities and interests, especially
        those he engaged in during his tenure at Comunidad Bet el in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and
        then at B'nai Jeshurun in New York City. The files document Meyer's professional activities,
        including his often over-lapping roles as religious leader, scholar, and human rights
        activist. Much of the material in the collection reflects Meyer's devotion and commitment to
        a socially and politically engaged Conservative Judaism and his involvement with Jewish
        communities around the world. Meyer was particularly involved in calling attention to human
        rights violations and working with the victims of violent political oppression in South and
        Central America in the 1970s and 1980s and then in Palestine, Israel, and the Middle East in
        the 1990s. Meyer's extensive involvement and leadership in national and international
        religious, peace, and human rights organizations such as the World Council of Churches are
        also well-represented, as is his life-long association with his alma maters, Dartmouth
        College and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.</p>
      <p> The Correspondence Series contains letters in English and Spanish written and received by
        Meyer (additional correspondence is also contained in Meyer's research files and electronic
        files). Significant correspondents include Louis Finkelstein, Abraham Joshua Heschel, and
        Shalom Spiegel.</p>
      <p> The Writings and Speeches Series holds Meyer's original compositions in English, Spanish,
        and Hebrew. These compositions include various literary genres (op-eds, newspaper articles,
        essays) as well as speeches, addresses, and sermons.</p>
      <p> The Research Files Series is subdivided into four categories: Geographic, Organizations,
        People, and Subject. These files may contain correspondence, notes, printed material,
        writings, and ephemera. The most common themes that run through this series include human
        rights, Jewish life, rabbinic education, Latin American Jewry, the Middle East, and
        Argentina's "Disappeared." The Research Files Series displays a deeper level of intellectual
        involvement by Meyer (e.g. annotations on printed material, categorizing and filing,
        integration of correspondence)</p>
      <p>The Printed Material Series includes newspapers, clippings, monographs, and serials that
        Meyer collected over the years. Subjects cover similar territory as the research files.
        Unlike the Research Files, this material is generally not annotated and was less
        organized.</p>
      <p>The Teaching Material Series contains material from classes taught by Meyer.</p>
      <p>The Personal Files Series includes material largely outside the scope of Meyer's
        professional work: photos, memorabilia, schoolwork, and appointment books. </p>
      <p>Video and audio recordings of Meyer's engagements are found in the Audiovisual Material
        Series. These include lectures, speeches, interviews, television appearances, and religious
        services. Originals of video and audio tape are closed to use. Patrons must request use
        copies to access the content of the material. </p>
      <p>The Condolences Series contains cards and notes expressing sympathy on Meyer's death. Many
        of these contain testimonials and reminiscences of his role as rabbi and activist.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Electronic Files Series contains transcriptions of documents authored by or
        related to Meyer, many of which overlap with the content of and the <emph render="bold"
          >Correspondence, Writings and Speeches, Teaching Material</emph>, and <emph render="bold"

            <p>Documents three types of oral addresses given by Meyer in English, Spanish, and
              Hebrew: first, speeches given by Meyer (these are often final drafts of addresses to
              various audiences: commencements, guest lectures, etc); second, transcripts of Meyer's
              classical music radio show, which he conducted while attending Dartmouth College
              between 1946-48; third, sermon notes which are rough, handwritten notes Meyer appeared
              to use while addressing more informal crowds, mainly religious in nature. Many of
              these sermon notes are for religious services conducted during the Jewish high
              holidays, and the majority are written in Hebrew. Speeches and sermon notes written on
              small notecards have been removed from boxes 8-11 and placed in smaller notecard boxes
              12-13. Some related materials can be found in the Electronic Files Series.</p>

            <p>Contains newspaper and journal articles, essays, and reflections on Meyer's
              experience in Argentina during the 1970s. Files also house two manuscripts that appear
              to be collections of written and oral works by Meyer. The 1985 manuscript appears to
              have been assembled by Meyer before his death, while the undated sample manuscript
              (often referred to as "The Big Message") was compiled posthumously. Grouped by type
              then arranged chronologically. Some related materials can be found in the Electronic

            information regarding Judaism, Latin America, human rights, peace and anti-war activism,
            NGO's and other areas in which Meyer was heavily involved. Although the material goes as
            far back as 1902, the bulk of the material is from the mid 1980s to the early 1990s.
            Files from Meyer's offices in Buenos Aires (up to 1984) and New York City (1984-1993)
            are present. All subseries are arranged alphabetically by folder title. Detailed

          <p>Consists of oversize files primarily from the Research Files Series. The bulk of the
            material comprises newspapers and clippings from or related to Argentina. Most of these
            chronicle the aftermath of the Dirty War/El Proceso. In addition to many clippings from
            Meyer's CONADEP files, articles on Madres de Plaza de Mayo, the trials of Argentina's
            military rulers in the mid-1980s, and the Catholic Church are included. While some
            clippings come from non-Argentine sources, most articles are published by domestic
            publications. In particular, a substantial collection of issues of the Jewish newspaper
              <title type="simple" render="italic">Nueva Presencia</title>, dated between 1980 and
            1987 can be found here. Issues of <title type="simple" render="italic">El Diario del
              Juicio</title> from 1985 complete the newspapers. Additional material is comprised of
            photographs, degrees, and other awards given to Meyer. Materials are arranged in date
            order.</p>
