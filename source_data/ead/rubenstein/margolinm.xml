        collection dates from 1947 to 1982 and includes twenty-five 16mm and seven Super 8 motion
        picture films created by Morris Margolin, chiefly documenting Morris and Dorothy's
        international travels. The films include footage from Pakistan, Bulgaria, Ethiopia, and
        Kenya -- rare destinations for Western travelers in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Highlights
        include an abundance of images of the Soviet Union and Israel, and images of Capetown
        documenting the apartheid years. All of the films are color, and a few include sound
        elements such as narration, music, or even sound effects. The collection also includes a
        handful of home movies that document family trips and events such as graduations and
        birthdays, and one film that appears to be a professionally produced documentary about the
        Soviet Union. The films are complemented by over 4,000 color slides of still images taken
        during their travels. The collection, arranged chronologically, also includes Digital
        Betacam preservation tapes, DVD masters and DVD use copies.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Born on July 28, 1908 in Brooklyn, New York, Morris Margolin spent most of his life in the
        New York metropolitan area. He graduated from New York University (NYU) in 1926 and taught
        accounting at Far Rockaway High School in Queens, New York from 1933 to 1940. Morris was the
        founding partner of Margolin, Winer &amp; Evans, an accounting firm established in Jamaica,
        New York, in 1946 that later moved to Garden City, Long Island. He was also a charter member
        and former president of the Jamaica, Queens, chapter of B'nai B'rith, a global Jewish
        community service organization.</p>
      <p>In 1936, Morris married Dorothy Safran. Dorothy was born to Polish parents in Budapest,
        Hungary, on July 28, 1911. Her family emmigrated to the United States in 1913 and settled in
        New York City. Dorothy graduated from NYU, where she studied Spanish language and culture,
        and also did graduate work. Dorothy was a lover of the arts and an active member of Women
        Strike for Peace. The couple had two daughters: Elaine, born in 1940, and Linda, born in
        1944.</p>
      <p>Morris was an amateur filmmaker, photography enthusiast, and classical music aficionado.
        The Margolins were avid travelers, taking an extensive series of international trips. Morris
        documented their travels through his photography and filmmaking and then shared his films
        with fellow members of the Metropolitan Film Club in Manhattan and at B'nai B'rith
        functions. The couple also hosted screenings in their home for friends and family.</p>
      <p>Morris retired in 1970, and the Margolins soon moved to Palm Beach, Florida, where Morris
        continued to share his films and photos with new friends. Morris passed away in 1990,
        Dorothy in 2007.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Morris and Dorothy Margolin Film Collection includes 32 home movies that capture the
        Margolins' travels between 1947 and 1976. Destinations represented in the collection include
        Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, England, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Greece,
        Hawaii, Hong Kong, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jamaica, Kenya, Majorca, Monaco, Morocco,
        Norway, Pakistan, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Romania, Scotland, South Africa, the Soviet Union,
        Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. All of the films are
        in color, and a few include sound. </p>
      <p>Also included is a handful of home movies that document family trips and events such as
        graduations and birthdays, and one film that appears to be a professionally produced
        documentary about the Soviet Union acquired by the Margolins during their travels. </p>
      <p>Particularly notable is the adventurous nature of many of the countries visited, such as
        the Soviet Union, Pakistan, Bulgaria, Ethiopia, and Kenya -- rare destinations for Western
        travelers in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. The films are also noteworthy because Morris often
        trained his camera on his surroundings, recording everyday life as well as architectural and
        geographical features of the countries he visited. His wife Dorothy also makes frequent
        appearances in the films.</p>
      <p>The films are complemented by over 4,000 color slides taken in most of these same countries
        from 1959 to 1982. Of particular interest are images from the former Soviet Union and
        Israel, both from the mid-1960s, images of South Africa during apartheid, as well as early
        images of France, Italy, and Thailand. </p>
      <p>Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</p>

      <head>Arrangement and technical notes</head>
      <p>The films are arranged chronologically and includes Super 8mm and 16mm reversal originals
        as well as Digital Betacam preservation tape masters and DVD masters. DVD use copies of each
        film are available to researchers. All of the films in the collection are in color. Many are
        silent, but some include sound elements such as voiceover narration, music, and even sound
        effects.</p>
      <p>Film titles were taken directly from original labels and typically give an overview of
        destinations visisted on a particular trip. For most films, a preliminary or detailed shot
        list is included in the collection guide. These provide more information on specific cities
        and sites visited. Reel numbers were assigned by archivists during processing; they
        generally reflect order of accession.</p>
      <p>The slides are also arranged chronologically, then alphabetically by country.</p>

          <p>In addition to creating film travelogs, the Margolins took many color photographs in
            the same countries, and had them formatted into color slides which they would then load
            into carousel trays and project at special gatherings. The vivid color images feature
            many kinds of buildings, inhabitants, street scenes, tourist sites, and natural
            landscapes. Occasionally Dorothy and Morris Margolin, family, and friends make an
            appearance. </p>
          <p>The earliest images were taken in France in 1959, and the latest dates are of a 1982
            trip to Italy. Of particular interest are over 200 hundred slides from Russia taken in
            the 1960s, and many images of Israel from the 1960s and 1971, as well as slides from
            South Africa during the apartheid era. There are also images from Florence in 1968,
            showing the consequences of the devastating flood of 1966. Other locations cover most of
            Europe and England, parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and a few locations in the U.S. and
            Canada.</p>
          <p>The over 4000 slides, arranged in chronological order and then alphabetically by
            country, were originally in carousel trays; their original projection sequencing has
            been preserved to the extent possible.</p>
