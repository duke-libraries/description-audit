      <abstract id="aspace_ddda4a5fa9116a36af3db9955db7fe49">Edwin L. and Terry A. Murray, brothers
        residing in Durham, N.C., have been collectors of comic books and other pulp culture for
        forty years. The Murray Fanzine Collection contains approximately 1150 comic book, science
        fiction and fantasy fanzines, collected by Edwin and Terry Murray, representing fandom in
        these genres from the early 1950s to 2019, as well as advertisements for fandom gatherings
        and conventions. The collection is organized into one series that is loosely separated into
        two sections: the first, and larger, consists of comic book fanzines ranging from the
        beginning of comic book fandom in the early 1960s to the retrospective volumes published in
        the early 2000s. The fanzines include reviews, advertisements and commentary, as well as
        biographical information on a variety of artists and writers, including Carl Barks, R.
        Crumb, Will Eisner, Steven King, Jack Kirby and Stan Lee. Though an assortment of superhero
        and comic strip characters published by DC, Dell and Marvel Comics, among others, are cited,
        one character in particular, Donald Duck, recieves more attention than the others. The
        second section consists of a sampling of science fiction and fantasy fanzines (including
        fantasy fiction) ranging from 1952 to the early 1980s, including information on artists and
        writers such as Vaughn Bode and Harlon Ellison. Most of the fanzines in the collection were
        printed independent of large scale publishing techniques, utilizing ditto, mimeograph,
        hectograph and, later, photocopy, on paper of varying degrees of quality. There are also
        three additional accessions (2010-0107, 2019-0078, 2019-0103), which have been minimally
        processed.</abstract>

      <p>Edwin L. and Terry A. Murray, brothers residing in Durham, N.C., have been collectors of
        comic books and other <emph render="doublequote">pulp culture</emph> for forty years. Edwin
        published his own fanzines, Vertigo and Trefoil, from the late 1960s through the mid 1980s.
        He graduated from Duke University in 1972. Edwin was at the center of comics fandom in the
        1960s and 1970s. Terry, a science fiction expert, is the author of Science Fiction Magazine
        Story Index, 1926-1995 (McFarland, 1999).</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p> The Murray Fanzine Collection contains approximately 1150 comic book, science fiction and
        fantasy fanzines representing fandom in these genres from the early 1950s to 2019. The
        collection is organized into one series that is loosely separated into two sections: the
        first, and larger, consists of comic book fanzines ranging from the beginning of comic book
        fandom in the early 1960s to the retrospective volumes published in the early 2000s. The
        second section consists of a sampling of science fiction and fantasy fanzines ranging from
        1952 to the early 1980s. Most of the fanzines in the collection were printed independent of
        large scale publishing techniques, utilizing ditto, mimeograph, hectograph and, later,
        photocopy, on paper of varying degrees of quality.</p>
      <p>Boxes 349-367 contain those fanzines pertaining to comic fandom. The earliest examples
        represented in the collection date to the early 1960s, just after the very first comic
        fanzines had appeared, including <title type="simple" render="italic">Alter Ego</title>,
        which is included here from issue 4, and <title type="simple" render="italic">Comic
          Art</title>. Other notable titles included in the collection from this era (often referred
        to as the Golden Age of Comic Fandom) are <title type="simple" render="italic"
          >Masquerader</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">Rocket's Blast/Comic
          Collector</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">Yancy Street Journal</title>,
          <title type="simple" render="italic">Batmania</title>, <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Comic Crusader</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">Gosh
          Wow!</title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">SPA FON</title>, as well as many
        others. Several of these issues contain photos and/or contributions from the Murray
        brothers, who had participated in comics fandom beginning in the mid 1960s. Fanzines
        dedicated to E.C. comics (such as <title type="simple" render="italic">Squa Tront</title>,
        and <title type="simple" render="italic">E.C. Fan Journal</title>), comprehensive indexing
        (such as <title type="simple" render="italic">Jerry Bails Authoritative Index to DC
          Comics</title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">Guidebook to Comic Fandom</title>,
        the <title type="simple" render="italic">MLJ Comic Index</title> and <title type="simple"
          render="italic">The Comic Fan's Guide to Periodical Literature</title>, which indexed
        early articles relating to comic books), conventions (such as the programs to the 1966 New
        York ComiCon and the 1968 International Convention of Comic Art, which is autographed by
        several of the artists in attendance), and amateur comic strips (such as <emph
          render="italic">Captain Biljo Comics</emph> and <emph render="italic">The Eye</emph>) are
        also represented from this era. Also included are issues 1-4 of <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Comics Review</title>, which contain the first published fiction by
        Stephen King.</p>
      <p>The era represented in the largest number is the 1970s, a time when the Murray brothers
        were very active in fandom, both in publishing as well as collecting. Though most of the
        issues represented in the collection from this era are single issues, some of the more
        popular titles, such as <title type="simple" render="italic">Bode' Bulletin</title>, <title
          type="simple" render="italic">New Fangles</title>, and <title type="simple"
          render="italic">In The Shadow of the Monolith</title>, are represented in larger numbers.
          <title type="simple" render="italic">Trefoil</title> and <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Vertigo</title>, both published by Edwin Murray, are represented in full.
        As nostalgia became big business in the 1980s, comic books and comic fandom became more
        marketable. In turn, a much larger percentage of publications dedicated to comic fandom and
        collecting benefitted from a higher production budget. In addition, the proliferation of the
        photocopy allowed for a higher production number on a smaller budget. These changes are
        represented in the collection, from the glossy Disney collectables magazine <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Storyboard</title> and the <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Fantaco Chronicles</title> Series, to the photocopied <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Barks Collector</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">Duckburg
          Times</title>, and <title type="simple" render="italic">The Stanley Steamer</title>.
        Though none of the major fanzines/magazines of the late 1980s and 1990s, such as the <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Comics Journal</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic"
          >Wizard</title>, and <title type="simple" render="italic">Comic Buyers Guide</title> are
        represented, several of the retrospective books on Comics Fandom published by Hamster Press
        are included in the collection. </p>
      <p>Boxes 368-372 contain fanzines relating to sci-fi and fantasy fandom, some of which are
        represented in both sections. Though not as complete a representation of the fandom of these
        genres as of the comics fandom genre, this section contains several of the top titles,
        including <title type="simple" render="italic">Don-O-Saur</title>, <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Tolkien Journal</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">SF
          Commentary</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">Lan's Lantern</title>, and <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Focal Point</title>. Also included is a 1952 issue of <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Science Fantasy Bulletin</title> published by Harlan
        Ellison, which was part of the initial wave of sci-fi fandom that was so influential to the
        beginnings of comic book fandom. It should also be noted that scattered throughout the
        collection are fanzines devoted to film, particularly horror and sci-fi films, as well as
        fliers (including one for the <emph render="doublequote">first symposium on Donald
          Duck</emph> held in the Geology department at Duke in 1970) and other assorted
        ephemera.</p>
      <p>There are also three additional accessions (2010-0107, 2019-0078, 2019-0103), which have
        been minimally processed.</p>
