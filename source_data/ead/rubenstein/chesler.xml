      <abstract id="aspace_015c847ac48764201c2f58174130f26e">The papers of Phyllis Chesler are
        divided into the following series: Writings, Custody Speakout Project, Women and Health
        Organizations, and Personal and Professional Papers. Chesler's Writings are separated into
        subseries by titles of her published works, and comprise the bulk of the collection. These
        papers include research files, interviews, and chapter drafts for her books Women and
        Madness; Women, Money and Power; About Men; Mothers on Trial; and Sacred Bond. The detailed
        research files in the Writings Series also contain audio tapes and selected transcripts of
        interviews conducted by Chesler in conjunction with her research on women and mental health,
        women's history, child custody (particularly the "Baby M" case involving the lawsuit between
        Mary Beth Whitehead and William Stern and baby Melissa Stern), and feminist concerns. The
        Writings Series includes Chesler's miscellaneous writings and provides insight into her
        personal and professional life through correspondence, manuscripts and notes surrounding
        each work as well as clippings and records documenting her feminist activism. Among the
        major correspondents are Carolyn Shaw Bell, Sheila Kaplan, Kate Millet, Tillie Olsen, Grace
        Paley, Adrienne Rich, Donna Shalala, Susan Sontag, and Gloria Steinem.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The papers of psychologist, radical feminist author, and professor Phyllis Chesler span the
        dates 1968-2001. For the most part, Chesler's original folder titles have been maintained
        throughout the collection. The collection is divided into the following series: <emph
          render="bold">Writings, </emph><emph render="bold">Custody Speakout Project, </emph><emph
          render="bold">Women and Health Organizations ,</emph><emph render="bold">Personal and
          Professional Papers, </emph><emph render="bold">International Committee for Women of the
          Wall ,</emph><emph render="bold">On the Issues,</emph> and <emph render="bold">Chronic
          Fatigue Syndrome.</emph> Chesler's <emph render="bold">Writings</emph> are separated into
        subseries by titles of her published works, and comprise the bulk of the collection. These
        papers include research files, interviews, and chapter drafts for her books <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Women and Madness;</title><title type="simple"
          render="italic">Women, Money and Power;</title><title type="simple" render="italic">About
          Men; </title><title type="simple" render="italic">With Child; </title><title type="simple"
          render="italic">Mothers on Trial; </title><title type="simple" render="italic">Sacred
          Bond; </title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">Letters to a Young
          Feminist</title>. The detailed research files in the <emph render="bold">Writings
          Series</emph> also contain audiocassettes and selected transcripts of interviews conducted
        by Chesler in conjunction with her research on women and mental health, women's history,
        childbirth and pregnancy, child custody and surrogate mothers (particularly the "Baby M"
        controversy concerning Mary Beth Whitehead and the Stern family), and feminist concerns. The
          <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph> includes Chesler's miscellaneous writings and
        provides insight into her personal and professional life through correspondence,
        manuscripts, and notes surrounding each work as well as clippings and records documenting
        her feminist activism. Materials related to <title type="simple" render="italic">Women of
          the Wall: Claiming Sacred Ground</title> can be found in the <emph render="bold"
          >International Committee for Women of the Wall Series</emph>. Chesler's complete writings
        from 1991 to the present, as well as selected archives of her writings from the 1970s and
        1980s are available at her website, <extref xlink:type="simple"
          xlink:href="http://www.phyllis-chesler.com/">The Phyllis Chesler
        Organization</extref>.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Personal and Professional Papers Series</emph> is subdivided into
        the following subseries:<emph render="bold">Teaching Material,</emph> which provides insight
        into Chesler's feminist activism and includes student evaluations and selected student
        papers for classes at the College of Staten Island and CUNY; <emph render="bold">Publicity
          Files,</emph> which contain reviews of Chesler's work as well as articles by and about
        her; <emph render="bold">Juvenilia,</emph> which documents Chesler's artistic and
        intellectual development through high school; <emph render="bold">People Files,</emph><emph
          render="bold">Financial Papers, </emph><emph render="bold">Correspondence,</emph> and
          <emph render="bold">Invitations.</emph> These latter four subseries document aspects of
        Chesler's personal and professional relationships and her family life. Among the major
        correspondents in the <emph render="bold">People Files Subseries</emph> are Carolyn Shaw
        Bell, Sheila Kaplan, Kate Millett, Tillie Olsen, Grace Paley, Adrienne Rich, Donna Shalala,
        Susan Sontag, and Gloria Steinem. The <emph render="bold">Custody Speakout Project
          Series</emph> and the <emph render="bold">Women and Health Organizations Series</emph>
        document Chesler's concern and activism for women's health and custody rights, while the
          <emph render="bold">International Committee for Women of the Wall Series</emph> documents
        Chesler's involvement in activism surrounding the right of women to pray at the Kotel with a
        Torah scroll, as well as her work as co-editor of the anthology <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Women of the Wall: Claiming Sacred Ground</title>. The <title
          type="simple" render="italic">On The Issues</title> Series contains correspondence,
        article and column drafts, pre-published and published issue files, financial materials,
        meeting notes, and other papers related to the publication of <title type="simple"
          render="italic">On The Issues</title>, a quarterly feminist magazine. Chesler served as an
        editor-at-large for the magazine, and she correspondedfrequently and worked closely with its
        publisher and editor-in-chief, Merle Hoffman. The Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Series contains
        Chesler's research and drafts of writings on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, also referred to by
        the acronyms CFS and CFIDS. </p>
      <p>Many American feminists are represented in Chesler's personal and professional
        correspondence in the <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph> as well as the <emph
          render="bold">People Files Subseries</emph> of the <emph render="bold">Personal and
          Professional Papers Series.</emph> The <emph render="bold">Invitations Subseries</emph> in
        that series documents Chesler's involvement in feminist, environmental, and other political
        events and protests. The <emph render="bold">Teaching Materials Subseries</emph> and the
          <emph render="bold">People Files Subseries</emph> contain correspondence, clippings,
        notes, and other miscellaneous materials related to individuals and institutions with which
        Chesler was in contact in the 1970s and 1980s. Much of the material in the <emph
          render="bold">People Files Subseries</emph> documents Chesler's personal and professional
        concerns following the publication of <title type="simple" render="italic">Women, Money and
          Power</title> and prior to publication of <title type="simple" render="italic">About
          Men</title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">With Child,</title> with a particular
        emphasis on her relationships with other feminist writers and activists.</p>
      <p>Chesler's professional literary career is documented in the <emph render="bold"
          >Correspondence Subseries</emph> of the <emph render="bold">Personal and Professional
          Papers Series</emph> which focuses on Chesler's relationships with publishers, promotion
        for her books, and royalty statements related to Chesler's books. The <emph render="bold"
          >Financial Papers Subseries</emph> also documents Chesler's business concerns and
        professional expenses. Further correspondence with publishers can be found in the research
        files of individual subseries within the <emph render="bold">Writings Series.</emph> The
          <emph render="bold">Women and Health Organizations Series,</emph><emph render="bold"
          >Custody Speakout Project Series,</emph> and the <emph render="bold">Invitations
          Subseries</emph> subseries of the <emph render="bold">Personal and Professional Papers
          Series</emph> provide information regarding the organizations supported by Chesler.</p>
      <p>Chesler's attention to women's custody rights appears in the <emph render="bold">Writings
          Series</emph> within the <emph render="bold">Mothers on Trial Subseries.</emph> The bulk
        of Chesler's work on child custody is documented in the <emph render="bold">Custody Speakout
          Project Series</emph> which contains organizational files including proposals, resource
        lists, fundraising projects, speaker information and agenda files for the Custody Speakout
        Project.</p>

              <p>The Committee for Mary Beth Whitehead was founded by Chesler during the "Baby M"
                trial as an agency to support the rights of Mary Beth Whitehead, "Baby M's" birth
                mother. The papers in this section chiefly document the administrative activities of
                this organization. The folders are arranged alphabetically.</p>

              other miscellaneous materials related to individuals and institutions with whom and
              which Chesler was in contact during this period. Much of the material in the series
              documents Chesler's personal and professional concerns following the publication of
                <title type="simple" render="italic">Women, Money and Power</title> and prior to
              publication of <title type="simple" render="italic">About Men</title> and <title
                type="simple" render="italic">With Child,</title> with a particular emphasis on her
              relationships with other feminist writers and activists. The folders are arranged by
              last name, except for the small number where Chesler's original folder title referred
              to an institution. These files are interfiled within the established alphabetical
              order, maintaining Chesler's original order.</p>
