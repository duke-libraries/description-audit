      <abstract id="aspace_f2fbb986c1292cd646f53600a6e8b0f8">R.C. Maxwell Company of Trenton, N.J.,
        was one of the earliest enduring outdoor advertising companies, founded in 1894 by Robert
        Chester Maxwell (1873-1955) and continued to operate primarily in the New Jersey, New York
        and Pennsylvania area until the company was sold in 2000. The R.C. Maxwell Company Records
        span the years 1891-2001 and include photographs and negatives, videocassettes, ledgers and
        account books, scrapbooks, correspondence and legal papers relating to the company's
        operations in outdoor advertising. Photographs and negatives in several formats (film, glass
        negatives, polaroid prints) document billboard designs for a variety of advertisers as well
        as depicting billboard and electric sign structures and their location relative to the
        surrounding environment. Urban locations include Times Square in New York and the Atlantic
        City, N.J., Boardwalk, where a number of photographs also document the Miss America beauty
        pageant parade and other parades in which the R.C. Maxwell Company participated. A few
        photographs document billboard construction and erection; there are also photographs of the
        Maxwell family and of Maxwell company staff and employees. Scrapbooks contain images of
        billboards and wall paintings produced by the Maxwell company as well as by David L. Clark,
        a High Point, N.C. artist and sign painter who was R.C. Maxwell's guardian. Other scrapbooks
        document primarily Coca-Cola signs of the early 20th century, as well as World War I support
        efforts including the U.S. Food Administration (under the direction of Herbert Hoover), the
        U.S. Fuel Administration, and Liberty Bond campaigns. Companies represented in the
        collection include the Boardwalk Advertising Signs Co., C&amp;B Electric Signs Co., Trenton
        Advertising Co., and Trenton Poster Advertising Co. Acquired as part of the John W. Hartman
        Center for Sales, Advertising &amp; Marketing History.</abstract>

      <p>R.C. Maxwell Company of Trenton, N.J., was one of the earliest enduring outdoor advertising
        companies. Founded in 1894 by Robert Chester Maxwell (1873-1954), the business followed
        burgeoning industry trends, beginning with a variety of outdoor advertising signage along
        New Jersey and New York roadways as well as at tourist destinations like Atlantic City,
        N.J., and New York's Times Square. With the commercial development of the incandescent bulb
        after World War I, the company began creating electric advertising signs in 1919. Maxwell
        saw great potential in these <emph render="doublequote">spectacular</emph> signs and
        established the Electric Sign Manufacturing Plant in Atlantic City, N.J. in the 1920s. This
        subsidiary created such giant ads as a 50-foot Colgate thermometer that was placed atop a
        building on the Atlantic City Boardwalk in 1922. The billboards and spectaculars themselves
        served as a form of advertising for the company, which displayed slogans such as <emph
          render="doublequote">Maxwell Did It</emph> and <emph render="doublequote">Maxwell
          Hits</emph> alongside its client's signs. R.C. Maxwell owned numerous billboards in
        Atlantic City, N.J., and a large number of pictures in this collection are located on the
        Atlantic City boardwalk.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The R.C. Maxwell Company Records span the years 1891-2001 and include photographs and
        negatives, videocassettes, ledgers and account books, scrapbooks, correspondence and legal
        papers relating to the company's operations in outdoor advertising. Photographs and

        include Times Square in New York and the Atlantic City, N.J., Boardwalk, where a number of
        photographs also document the Miss America beauty pageant parade and other parades in which
        the R.C. Maxwell Company participated. A few photographs document billboard construction and
        erection; there are also photographs of the Maxwell family and of Maxwell company staff and
        employees. Scrapbooks contain images of billboards and wall paintings produced by the
        Maxwell company as well as by David L. Clark, a High Point, N.C. artist and sign painter who
        was R.C. Maxwell's guardian. Other scrapbooks document primarily Coca-Cola signs of the

        Administration (under the direction of Herbert Hoover), the U.S. Fuel Administration, and
        Liberty Bond campaigns. Companies represented in the collection include the Boardwalk
        Advertising Signs Co., C&amp;B Electric Signs Co., Trenton Advertising Co., and Trenton
        Poster Advertising Co. </p>
      <p>Approximately 15,000 photographs, dating up to around 1952, have been described in the
        searchable <extref xlink:href="http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/road/">ROAD
          Database</extref> (Resource of Outdoor Advertising Descriptions). The numbered and indexed
        black-and-white photographs and negatives (along with a limited number of glass negatives)
        include images of billboard and electric spectacular executions (illuminated billboards);
        road shots showing the approach views to billboard structures; images of Maxwell advertising
        structures; and images of urban and rural billboard displays in various states, primarily
        Pennsylvania and New Jersey, including a number of images of Times Square in New York and
        the Atlantic City, N.J. boardwalk. Because the majority of photographs show the billboards
        in their surroundings, the images provide a snapshot of the people and buildings near the
        billboard. </p>

          <p>Boxes DB1-DB3 contain prints made from glass negatives. Many are undated, but are
            grouped together at the beginning of the series because of their format.</p>
          <p>The contents of Boxes DB4-DB6 are arranged according to the numbering systems used by
            the Maxwell Company between 1916-1920. Maxwell used several different methods for
            cataloging their photograph collection until around 1918, when the company settled on a
            single, sequential numbering system. The photographs numbered in this fashion begin in
            Box DB7. There is thus a chronological overlap among the material in Boxes DB5-DB9. All
            Maxwell Company numbers are listed immediately under the date of the photographs
            contained in the box.</p>
          <p>In addition to the Maxwell Company number, items in the <emph render="bold">Photographs
              Included in the ROAD Database </emph> Series have been assigned ROAD database numbers.
            A database number beginning with an <emph render="doublequote">XXG</emph> prefix denotes
            images made from glass negatives; <emph render="doublequote">XXH</emph> denotes images
            primarily from the 1940s (World War II era) but also include a few items in the 1930s;
            and all other Maxwell images in the ROAD database begin with an <emph
              render="doublequote">XXX</emph> prefix. All ROAD database numbers are listed after the
            Maxwell numbers under each box number. The <emph render="doublequote">XXH</emph> numbers
            are out of database order, but are in chronological order. This reflects the fact that
            this set of photographs was processed separately under a slightly different
            organizational plan.</p>
          <p>Where applicable, individual folders have been stamped indicating that a corresponding
            negative is available in the <emph render="bold">Negatives Series (Restricted)</emph> of
            this collection.</p>
