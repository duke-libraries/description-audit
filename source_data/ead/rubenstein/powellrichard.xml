          <p>The series includes texts, newspaper articles, exhibition publicity, notes, and letters
            dating from approximately 1977 to 2010, which Powell maintained by topic or, in the case
            of cultural institutions, organizational name. The series includes correspondence with
            museums, such as the Smithsonian African-American Museum, the New Orleans Museum of Art,
            and the Addison Gallery of American Art, as well as numerous art galleries in New York
            and London. There are also materials regarding Powell's publications in the <title
              type="simple" render="italic">Art Bulletin</title>, his work on various exhibitions,
            research trips to Barbados, and printed texts that Powell used in his Duke classes, many
            of which he annotated.</p>

            <p>The <title type="simple" render="italic">Homecoming: The Art and Life of William H.
                Johnson</title> subseries contains extensive material Powell created and compiled in
              the course of researching and writing about African American artist William H. Johnson
              for his doctoral dissertation, Fulbright fellowship in Denmark, book, and exhibition
              at the Smithsonian National Museum of American Art. These materials include notebooks,
              a list of contacts in Scandinavia, and various printed texts pertaining to William H.
              Johnson written by Powell and other scholars. There is correspondence regarding a
              legal claim made by Johnson's family, publicity materials for the exhibition and
              numerous reviews in both American and Scandinavian newspapers and magazines, and
              extensive images. This latter group is further subdivided into two section organized
              by subject or theme. The first group contains images that chronicle the life of
              William H. Johnson, such as portraits, group images, and photographs at gallery
              openings, and the second section documents Johnson's artwork.</p>

              Powell served as the curator for the exhibition and was extensively involved in the
              exhibition catalogue. In addition to the exhibition, he taught an undergraduate class
              at Duke University on the subject in Fall 1998, and planning and lecture materials for
              this course are included. This subseries contains newspaper clippings and articles
              concerning the controversial David Hammons work "How Ya Like Me Now?" which was
              erected and quickly destroyed during Dr. Powell's tenure as curator and acting
              co-director at W.P.A.</p>

            associates in Detroit, Italy, and France. An exhibition proposal for a show on Donyale
