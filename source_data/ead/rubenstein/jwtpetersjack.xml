            (JWT), founded in 1864, is one of the oldest and largest enduring advertising agencies
            in the United States. Jack Peters worked at JWT 31 years and served as Chief Operating
            Officer and President of JWT-USA (1984-1987) and JWT-Worldwide (1986-1987). The Jack
            Peters Papers span the years 1965-1989 and document Peters' career, especially his role
            in JWT's international offices, and with the Ford Motor Company advertising account. The
            collection includes general files related to JWT policies, procedures and personnel,
            advertising research reports, correspondence files, campaign proofs and launch
            materials, files related to media campaign strategies, presentation notes and scripts.
            The collection also contain marketing plans, evaluations and reports for a number of
            JWT's domestic and international offices, including Argentina, Canada, South Africa as
            well as offices in Europe and Asia. Represented clients include Eastman Kodak, Ford,
            Goodyear, Kellogg, Kraft, Miller beer, Twentieth Century Fox, Unilever, and
            Warner-Lambert.</abstract>
