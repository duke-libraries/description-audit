      <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>Judy Richardson was born in Tarrytown, New York, and attended Swarthmore College before
        joining the civil rights movement in 1963. She worked for the Student Nonviolent
        Coordinating Committee from 1963 to 1966, with posts in Atlanta, Mississippi, and Alabama.
        She worked for the Mississippi Freedom Summer Project and also coordinated the operation of
        a Residential Freedom School in 1965.</p>
      <p>Richardson then joined the staff of the Drum and Spear bookstore in Washington, D.C., and
        spent several years serving as its children's editor and director (1968-1972). During the
        1970s she also founded and managed the Maelezo Bookstore (1972-1973), worked for and later
        directed the Black Student Fund (1973-1977), and meanwhile took college courses at both
        Howard University and Columbia University. She eventually earned a degree in children's
        literature from Antioch College (1977).</p>
      <p>Richardson joined Blackside, Inc., in 1978, becoming an advisor and then associate producer
        of Eyes on the Prize I and II, an award-winning PBS series on the civil rights movement. She
        also co-produced Blackside's Malcolm X: Make It Plain, another documentary. In 1982, she
        began working for the United Church of Christ's Commission for Racial Justice, writing
        commentaries and serving as its Director of Information from 1984 until 1989. Richardson
        worked for Blackside until 1999, serving as producer and education director. In 2001, she
        joined Northern Light Productions, and produced several historical documentaries and
        educational films. </p>
      <p>Richardson co-edited Hands on the Freedom Plow: Personal Accounts by Women in SNCC, which
        was published by University of Illinois Press in 2010. She became a distinguished visiting
        professor at Brown University in 2012.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>This series includes drafts, edits, and correspondence between Richardson, her fellow
            editors, and the book's contributors over the ten years of work prior to the publication
            of Hands on the Freedom Plow: Personal Accounts by Women in SNCC (published in 2010 by
            University of Illinois Press). The materials have been arranged into three subseries:
            Drafts/Editing; Publication; and Correspondence. </p>
          <p>Drafts/Editing includes work by the volume's six editors: Faith S. Holsaert, Martha
            Prescod Norman Noonan, Judy Richardson, Betty Garman Robinson, Jean Smith Young, and
            Dorothy M. Zellner. All of the editors are SNCC veterans who solicited contributions
            from other women who joined the SNCC organization during the civil rights movement. The
            subseries includes name files for each contributor, including several contributors who
            were not published in the final version of the volume. The files typically include both
            the original and subsequent drafts written by each author for Hands. This subseries also
            includes the editors' work in writing introductions and transitions between each segment
            and chapter of the text.</p>
          <p>The Publications subseries largely consists of marketing and publicity files leading up
            to and following the book's publication in 2010.</p>
          <p>The Correspondence subseries includes Richardson's copies of exchanges between the
            editors, the contributors, and the publishers of the volume. Typically these are
            Richardson's email printouts, occasionally accompanied by personal notes or drafts of
            emails.</p>

          <p>This series contains Richardson's original documents from the Student Nonviolent
            Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and other civil rights organizations, including the
            Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.
            Files are arranged into three subseries: SNCC, the Residential Freedom School, and Ralph
            Featherstone.</p>
          <p>The SNCC subseries includes newsletters, internal memoranda, and official circulars
            from several SNCC offices, including the national office and the New York office. The
            subseries contains material from various SNCC initiatives and partnerships, such as the
            Mississippi Summer Project, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, civil rights
            conferences and demonstrations, the Julian Bond senatorial campaign, Black Panther
            literature, informational brochures on voter registration and organizing, and other
            miscellaneous printed materials. It also includes materials documenting Richardson's
            involvement in the Mississippi Summer Project, the campus travellers program, and the
            Heart of Atlanta hotel sit-in demonstration.</p>
          <p>The Residential Freedom School subseries includes Richardson's work on establishing,
            funding, and running a Residential Freedom School in Alabama during the summer of 1965.
            It includes correspondence, registration information, logistical and administrative
            files, and program evaluations for the school.</p>
          <p>The Death of Ralph Featherstone subseries contains documents acquired and collected by
            Richardson following the purported assassination of Ralph Featherstone and William "Che"
            Payne in Maryland. Featherstone worked with Richardson at Drum and Spear Bookstore in

          <p>This series contains two subseries: Blackside, Inc., and Northern Light Productions.
            Files are arranged loosely by project or documentary. Additional research materials from
            these projects can be found in the Subject Files Series.</p>
          <p>Blackside, Inc., includes some of Richardson's research and manuscripts from the
            production of Eyes on the Prize and Eyes on the Prize II, as well as scripts and
            accompanying publications from the production of Malcolm X: Make It Plain. The subseries
            documents Richardson's roles in the development and promotion of these projects and
            their educational components. Richardson also collected publicity and student/teacher
            reactions to the series.</p>
          <p>The Northern Light Productions subseries includes Richardson's files on the Little Rock
            Central High School historical exhibits, Scarred Justice: The Orangeburg Massacre
            project; and Slave Catchers/Slave Resisters and its spin-off projects on slavery in New
            England.</p>

          <p>Richardson's "work products," as she referred to them, have been arranged
            alphabetically in this Project Files Series. Dates range from the 1970s through the
            2000s, and include materials documenting Richardson's service on various committees,
            panels, and campaigns, as well as some of her articles and writings (listed by
            publication title). A significant amount of files are grouped under the SNCC Alumni
            heading, referring to reunions, conferences, and other post-civil rights movement
            projects undertaken by Richardson relating to SNCC.</p>

          <p>The Event Files Series has been loosely arranged chronologically, with correspondence,
            pamphlets, and ephemera from many of Richardson's engagements sorted by year. Events
            with substantial documentation have been filed individually following the "general"
            files for that year.</p>

          <p>Richardon's Personal Materials Series includes her files from various interviews and
            press coverage she has received; personal correspondence files arranged loosely by year;
            miscellaneous photographs and clippings; and her FOIA files from 1983. The FOIA
            subseries includes redacted FBI files from the agency's surveillance of Richardson
            during 1964 and 1969, both for her work in SNCC and her affiliations with the Black
            Panther Party during her years at Drum and Spear.</p>
