        documentarian Rob Amberg span the years 1975-2009. The gelatin silver prints and pigmented
        inkjet color prints in the collection represent three bodies of work: The New Road: I-26 and
        the Footprints of Progress; The Sodom Laurel Album; and The Vanishing Culture of
        Agriculture. Amberg focuses primarily on the social life and customs of the rural South,
        especially in the mountains of his home state of North Carolina. Images range from landscape
        shots taken before and during construction of an interstate highway in the N.C. mountains,
        to portraits of individuals and families affected by the changes in rural culture. Images
        also depict agricultural activies such as tobacco cultivation and dairy cattle farming, as
        well as work in the poultry industry. He has a special concern for documenting the way in
        which industrial and economic progress seems to be erasing many aspects of rural culture at
        the turn of the twenty-first century. Amberg's papers account for the rest of the collection
        and are organized into five series: Correspondence, Printed Materials, Subject Files, and
        Writings and Research, and Audio. Acquired as part of the Archives of Documentary Arts at
        Duke University.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Rob Amberg Photographs and Papers span the years 1975-2009. The photographs consist of
        8x10 and 11x14 inch gelatin silver prints and pigmented inkjet color prints. Amberg's focus
        as a photographer is primarily the social customs of the rural South, especially in his home
        state of North Carolina. He has a special concern for documenting the way in which
        industrial and economic progress seems to be erasing many aspects of rural culture at the
        turn of the twenty-first century. </p>
      <p>The collection is arranged into three project series: <emph render="bold">The New Road:
          I-26 and the Footprints of Progress</emph> ; <emph render="bold">The Sodom Laurel
          Album</emph>; and <emph render="bold">The Vanishing Culture of Agriculture</emph>. </p>
      <p>Images range from landscape shots taken before and during construction of an interstate
        highway in the N.C. mountains, to portraits of individuals and families affected by the
        changes in rural culture. Images also depict agricultural activies such as tobacco
        cultivation and dairy cattle farming, as well as work in the poultry industry. Many of
        Amberg's images in this last series were funded by the Rural Advancement Fund to document
        the rural Carolinas, and by the Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation. Captions and numbering are
        taken from original notes on the back of each print. Series are arranged in alphabetical
        order by title of project.</p>
      <p>Amberg's papers are organized into five series. The <emph render="bold">Correspondence
          Series</emph> contains incoming messages regarding exhibits and the publication of
        Amberg's books as well as photographic work in other published materials.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Printed Material Series</emph> consists of publications which
        include or feature his images. Publications in the series are both national and local,
        including <title render="italic">The New York Times</title> and <title render="italic"
          >Harper's</title>.</p>
      <p>Amberg worked and contributed to a number of non-profit organizations dealing with farm
        worker's rights and other social issues. Collections of materials relating to these
        non-profits are housed in the <emph render="bold">Subject Files Series</emph>. Printed
        materials in this series include annual reports and publications by each organization. Most
        of the materials include photography work by Amberg.</p>
      <p>Included in Amberg's papers is the <emph render="bold">Writings and Research Series</emph>.
        Content includes multiple versions of the manuscripts to <title render="italic">The New
          Road: I-26 and the Footprints of Progress</title> and <title render="italic">Sodom Laurel
          Album</title>, a publisher's draft of <title render="italic">Quartet: Four North Carolina
          Photographers,</title> a number of interview transcripts, and other writings by Amberg and
        others.</p>
      <p>The final grouping in the collection is the <emph render="bold">Audio Series</emph> which
        includes a piece entitled Interstate 26 produced by Leda Hartman and a copy of the musical
        recording which accompanies <title render="italic">Sodom Laurel Album</title>.</p>

          <p>Consists of 127 photographs, the majority of which are 11x14 inch gelatin silver
            prints, although there is a small series of digital color prints. Through images of
            landscapes, individuals, and communities, the photographs provide an intimate, long-term
            look at the social, cultural, and environmental impact of the construction of an
            interstate highway through rural Madison County, North Carolina. The series is divided

          <p>Consists of 87 11x14 black and white prints documenting agricultural life in North
            Carolina, Minnesota, Alabama, Kentucky, and South Carolina. Many of the images are from
            North Carolina and were part of an on-going assignment funded by the Rural Advancement
            Fund to document the rural Carolinas; others formed part of an annual report assigned
            and supported by the Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation. Several images document organic
            farmers and their activities, and one of the last African-American dairy farmers in N.C.
            Original captions and numbering taken from back of prints. Arranged numerically by
            negative number.</p>
