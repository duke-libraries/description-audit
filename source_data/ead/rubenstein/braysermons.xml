            southern Virginia in the early twentieth century. Collection of 74 unpublished
            typewritten sermons and texts for prayer meetings assembled by a Methodist minister
            active in Virginia in the early twentieth century. Although no author's name is given,
            from church appointment records it is almost certain that the minister is John Luke Bray
            (1871-1938). The sermons were given from 1907 to 1938 in localities in southern Virginia
            (almost all in Danville, Crewe, South Boston, Richmond, and Norfolk); the earliest
            sermon was given in Shawnee, Oklahoma. At times the minister may have been using
            churches that offered space to other denominations. The sermon notes, typed in red and
            black and typically two to four pages, document the typical style of Methodist preaching
            in the South and sometimes refer to social or economic issues. Each envelope enclosing
            the sermon text is marked with the title and when and where preached; most have multiple
            dates and locations. There are also a few miscellaneous items, including newspaper
            clippings, handwritten notes, and one leaf with an undated hymn with words by A. W.
            Davis, entitled "Over the Top With Jesus," dedicated to a "Rev. D. H. Kenney." Some
            fragile items have been photocopied. Arranged in two series: Prayer Meetings and
            Sermons.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>The minister who authored these sermons was undoubtedly a member of the Methodist Church
            South, and from church appointment records he is almost certainly John Luke Bray.
            According to Bray's obituary in the <title type="simple" render="italic">Virginia
               Conference Annual</title> (1938), he was born in 1871 in Gloucester County, Virginia
            to John and Sarah Luke Bray, and entered the Methodist ministry in the Virginia
            Conference at the age of 18. He was at Randolph-Macon College for an unspecified period
            but did not graduate. At some point he was reportedly Superintendent of the Masonic
            Orphanage in Richmond. He married Pauline Clements of Gloucester, Virginia early in his
            career. In 1901 he left for the West, and seems to have been minister of the Methodist
            Church in Shawnee, Oklahoma (then Indian territory) in 1906. He returned to Virginia in
            1907; a year later Taylor University in Indiana had conferred on him the Divinity
            Degree. Going by the sermons that survive in this collection, by 1911 he was preaching
            in Virginia. His first appointment may have been in Lambert's Point, Virginia (near
            Norfolk). He then was appointed to various large congregations in Richmond and the
            Norfolk area, then migrated to smaller churches in Southern Virginia. He died in 1938,
            perhaps in Crewe, Virginia, a small community where he held his last appointment, and is
            buried in Richmond.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Collection of 74 unpublished typewritten sermons and texts for prayer meetings (also
            called sermons) assembled by a Methodist minister active in Virginia in the early
            twentieth century. Although no author's name is given, from church appointment records
            it is almost certain that the minister is John Luke Bray (1871-1938). The sermons were
            given from 1907 to 1938 in localities in southern Virginia (almost all in Danville,
            Crewe, South Boston, Richmond, and Norfolk); the earliest sermon (1907) was given in
            Shawnee, Oklahoma. The minister served for several years in each church, the last
            sermons of 1936-1938 being given in the Methodist Church in the railroad town of Crewe,
            Va., which possibly also served a Baptist congregation, an arrangement not unusual in
            rural areas. The sermon notes, typed in red and black and typically two to four pages in
            length, offer evidence of the typical style of preaching in Methodist churches in the
            South and sometimes refer to social or economic issues. Each envelope enclosing the
            sermon text is marked with the title, taken from a Biblical text, and when and where
            preached; most have multiple dates and locations. Most envelopes are marked in a corner
            as "Sermon Notes," but some are labeled "Prayer Meetings," with the text inside still
            labeled by the minister as a sermon. There are also a few miscellaneous items, including
            newspaper clippings, handwritten notes, and one leaf with an undated hymn with words by
            A. W. Davis, entitled "Over the Top With Jesus," dedicated to a "Rev. D. H. Kenney."
            Some fragile items have been photocopied. Arranged in two series: <emph render="bold"
               >Prayer Meetings</emph> and <emph render="bold">Sermons</emph>, with the bulk of the
            sermons housed in the latter group. Within each series, arranged in Biblical order.</p>
