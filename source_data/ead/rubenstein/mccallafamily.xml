      <p>John Moore McCalla was a lawyer, Democratic politician, brigadier general of Kentucky
        militia, and second auditor of the United States. He was the son of Dr. Andrew J. and Martha
        (More) McCalla. John McCalla married Maria Frances Hogg and had three sons, Dr. John M.
        McCalla, Jr.; Andrew J. McCalla; and Thomas McCalla. Dr. John M. McCalla, Jr. married Helen
        Varnum Hill and they had a daughter names Isabel Hill McCalla. Isabel married Edmond Lee
        Goldsborough and had three children: Edmond Lee, John McCalla, and Helen Louisa. </p>
      <p>McCalla attended Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He joined the Lexington
        Light Artillery Co. in 1812 and found himself part of the Fifth Regiment of Kentucky
        Volunteer Militia. The Kentucky troops were sent to the relief of besieged Frenchtown on
        River Raisin, Michigan, where they underwent massacre and imprisonment when General James
        Winchester surrendered on Jan. 22, 1813.</p>
      <p>After his military career, McCalla Sr. became interested in many different areas. He had
        political ambitions along with studying law. He became the U.S. Marshal of Kentucky, and on
        March 31, 1845 was appointed second auditor of the U. S. Treasury under James Polk's
        administration. His term lasted until 1849, at which time he focused on his law practice.
        McCalla was an ardent Democrat and was welcomed to the American Party in 1854. He was a
        political opponent of Henry Clay and a supporter of Andrew Jackson. Following the war he
        supported Andrew Johnson.</p>
      <p>Dr. John McCalla Jr. worked as a clerk and physician during the Civil War. He also traveled
        to Liberia as part of the American Colonization Society in 1860.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The John M. McCalla Family Papers contain correspondence, personal, business, political,
        financial, military, and legal items, pamphlets, journals, letter books, ledgers, newspaper
        clippings, various volumes, and a family cook book. </p>
      <p>Papers of John Moore McCalla (b. 1793), lawyer, politician, brigadier general of the
        Kentucky militia, and the second auditor of the United States constitute the bulk of this
        collection. The papers cover important historical events such as the War of 1812; several
        presidential elections, including Jackson, Polk, and Lincoln; The Mexican War; the
        annexation of Texas and Oregon; and the rise of the American Party. Letters dating from the
        Civil War period include discussions of McCalla Jr.'s work with the Quartermaster General
        and the Surgeon General's offices; Seminary Military Hospital in Georgetown; the ongoing
        military campaigns; and McCalla Sr.'s pro-South sympathies.</p>
      <p>Volumes included cover several subject areas: financial and estate accounts, weather
        reports, an index to cases in Congress in the 1850s, and an accounting of property rental
        and construction; a pamphlet, 1839, with an address given at the fiftieth anniversary of the
        Lexington Light Infantry; a journal, 1860-1861, of Dr. John M. McCalla, Jr., written while
        he was an agent for the U. S. government in the return of slaves captured from a slaver,
        describing his journey to Liberia, the political and social conditions there, and life in
        Washington, D.C., in 1861; ledgers to the estates left to Helen Varnum (Hill) McCalla
        (including estates from James M. Varnum, Joseph B. Varnum, and Silas N. Hill); and a book
        listing gifts received by the family from the 1890s.</p>
      <p>Family papers include journals and notes from various McCalla women, including Helen Louise
        Sargent; documentation of travel, family relationships, and estate business; clippings,
        including reports of political disputes in Kentucky; and other miscellaneous items. </p>

          <p>The Correspondence is arranged chronologically. Correspondence discusses personal and
            family matters; presidential elections; the Mexican War; the annexation of Texas and
            Oregon (1845); the activities of McCalla and others in the Democratic and American
            Parties; the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln and the coming of the Civil War; various
            business ventures in Kentucky and Washington, D.C.; letters from several former McCalla
            slaves who settled in Liberia (circa 1834 and 1836); conditions in the Eastern Lunatic
            Asylum in Lexington, Kentuckey (circa 1826); McCalla's duties as U.S. marshal for the
            District of Kentucky; and his service as 2nd auditor in the Treasury Department. </p>
          <p>Some of the letters in this series discuss personal or financial matters. For example,
            on Dec. 15, 1818, McCalla writes to Congressman Henry Clay asking his assistance in
            gaining compensation from the government. There are also 1820s letters between John
            McCalla and his brother, William Latta McCalla (a controversial Presbyterian minister),
            discussing personal difficulties, their families, and the Ebenezer Presbytery of
            Kentucky. Beginning in 1828, and continuing into the 1850s, a personal correspondence
            develops between John McCalla and Medard Coutre of Frenchtown, Monroe County, Michigan.
            Both men had participated in the River Basin Campaign of 1812-1813, and Coutre’s family
            settled on the site of the battle of Jan. 22, 1813.</p>
          <p>The Correspondence also contains a large number of letters discussing political matters
            and disputes. Letters about the character and affairs of Henry Clay are written by Duff
            Green (1829), Thomas Patrick Moore (June 24, 1829) and S.H. Laughlin of Nashville (Sept.
            2, 1844). John McLean, Supreme Court Justice, writes to congratulate McCalla on his
            appointment as U.S. Marshal on Feb. 16, 1830. On March 31, 1845, McCalla was appointed
            second auditor of the U. S. Treasury and immediately moved his family to Washington D.C.
            His term lasted until 1849. With Taylor's election, General McCalla left the Treasury
            Department to enter private law practice in Washington. Wm. 0. Butler writes in 1851 on
            his candidacy for the Presidency. There are details on the second auditor's office as
            McCalla gathers material for charges against his successor, Philip Clayton. With
            Franklin Pierce in office, McCalla again sought governmental appointment. In 1853,
            Pierce received letters from several individuals, all recommending that McCalla be
            re-appointed as second auditor.</p>
          <p>On June 8, 1860, John McCalla's son, Dr. John Moore McCalla, Jr., becomes agent for the
            United States government in the return of slaves captured from a slaver. Materials
            related to his work with the American Colonization Society are also present in the
            Personal Papers series.</p>
          <p>Along with business correspondence, McCalla's letter books contain financial accounts,
            poetry, property rentals, personal correspondence, and construction information. From
            the 1830s through the 1850s, these letter books contain mostly business correspondence
            of McCalla to various government officials, including President Andrew Jackson.</p>

          <p>Financial Papers include business papers, account books, ledgers, daybooks, household
            accounts, bills and receipts, and tax records. Financial papers document the names of
            businesses in Washington, D. C., and include a number of tax assessments in that city.
            Ledgers chronicle John Moore McCalla’s time as United State auditor and his duties while
            in that position. Among the financial items are several books dealing with the account
            of J. B. Varnum.</p>

          <p>This series contains both militia and legal papers, including deeds, wills, claims,
            leases, contracts, law licenses, indentures, papers dealing with the settlement of
            estates and McCalla's legal practice, militia rosters, accounts, petitions to sue, and
            court martial proceedings from the War of 1812. Interesting property involved is from
            estates of J. M. Varnum whose heirs are Helen V. Hill and Mary Isabel Hill for one part
            and Joseph B. Varnum on the other. This estate, centered in Washington real estate and
            securities, continued through the life of Isabel (McCalla) Goldsborough and Helen Hill
            Goldsborough.</p>
          <p>On March 31, 1845, McCalla was appointed second auditor of the U.S. Treasury and
            immediately relocated to Washington. Many of the papers date from his time in office. </p>
          <p>In an affidavit of Sept. 24, 1844, John McKee claims to have seen Henry Clay drinking
            spirits and using profanity, in Richmond, Kentucky in the fall of 1841. An index refers
            to cases in Congress during the 1950s and there is an address given at the fiftieth
            anniversary of the Lexington Light Infantry.</p>

          <p>Personal papers contain collected newspaper clippings (pertaining to workers’ rights,
            especially women and children, religion, and political disputes), hymns, poetry,
            journals, art books, a cook book, and miscellaneous. McCalla’s personal writings,
            including short stories, lectures, articles and poetry, are also filed in this series,

            Jr., McCalla’s son. He documents his journey to Liberia from 1860-1861 when he was
            appointed as an agent for the U.S. government in the return of slaves captured from a
            slave ship. The rough draft of a book entitled “Select Reader Comprising of Choice
            Extracts, In prose and verse, adapted to the use of the public and private schools,” by
            Louisa McCalla is also included.</p>

            <p>John Moore McCalla, Jr., kept a journal of a trip to Liberia in 1860 which concluded
              with brief entries on Washington, D.C., in 1861. The McCallas were active members of
              the American Colonization Society which worked in 1860 with the U.S. government to
              return to Africa 383 captives seized by a U.S. warship from a slaver. The slaves were
              brought into Key West, Florida, where the Colonization Society sent two ships, Star of
              the Union and South Shore, to pick up the Africans and transport them to Liberia. Dr.
              McCalla was appointed agent of the U.S. government by Secretary of Interior Jacob
              Thompson, and Dr. J. M. Grymes was named surgeon for the Colonization Society.</p>
            <p>Dr. McCalla started on June 13, 1860, from New York by ship for Key West. He
              describes the town while awaiting the departure of the Star of the Union (p. 18). The
              Africans were from the Wydah tribe, whose customs are well described by Dr. McCalla.
              After seasickness and the death of a number of Africans, the ship arrived at Monrovia,
              Liberia, on Sept. 2, 1860, where the South Shore also docked about the same time.
              While part of the freed slaves were being landed at Monrovia, Dr. McCalla visited the
              town and described its houses. He met Judge Wilson and Dr. Joseph Jenkins Hoberts
              (1809-18?6), the black representatives of the American Colonization Society, as well
              as President Stephen A. Benson of Liberia and the missionary, the Rev. Alfred F.
              Russell. Dr.McCalla describes in detail a dinner at the home of the first President of
              Liberia, Dr. Joseph Roberts, and his wife, Jane (Waring) Roberts. </p>
            <p>The Star of the Union sails to Greenville, Liberia, to land the last of the freed
              slaves. Koontown is described. Comment is made (p. 66) on the two Llberian political
              parties, True Liberians and Whigs. Dr. McCalla is interested in the native plants he
              finds and notes the ships which come and go frequently. He begins his return voyage on
              Sept. 21, 1860, stopping at Grand Turk and Salt Cay in the West Indies to take on a
              cargo of salt.</p>
            <p>This portion of the journal contains a clipping, Apr. 8, 1870, from the New York
              Herald, reporting the wretched conditions of life in Liberia, the high death rate, and
              poor schools.</p>
