        and teaching materials; photographs, artwork, and scrapbooks; audio and video recordings;
        and materials related to labor organizing and protests across the U.S. Hundreds of
        student-led projects document through interviews, essays, photographs, videos, and other
        materials the lives of migrant farmworkers and their working conditions, mostly in NC but
        also in SC. Major themes in the collection include: history, working conditions, and abuses
        of migrant farmworkers in the U.S.; education and outreach efforts; housing, health, and
        pesticide safety; leadership development for migrant youth; grassroots theater; labor
        organizing and boycotts; and service learning. Materials are in English and Spanish.

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Adapted from Student Action with Farmworkers website: http://saf-unite.org/</p>
      <p>Founded in 1992, Student Action with Farmworkers is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization whose
        mission is to bring students and farmworkers together to learn about each other's lives,
        share resources and skills, improve conditions for farmworkers, and build diverse coalitions
        working for social change. SAF accomplishes its mission by working with farmworkers to
        address their concerns through documentation of human rights violations, grassroots
        education and mobilization, leadership development of young people, policy advocacy, and
        support of labor organizing.</p>
      <p>Student Action with Farmworkers (SAF) traces its history to the 1970s when child
        psychiatrist Dr. Robert Coles and professor Bruce Payne led twelve Duke University students
        in a summer-long Migrant Project, investigating conditions in NC migrant camps, testifying
        before the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and successfully lobbying for the
        creation of NC Farmworker Legal Services. In the early 1980s, Payne and other faculty and
        students at Duke founded the Interns in Conscience project of the Hart Leadership Program,
        and groups of students went to southern Florida during summer breaks to work with agencies
        serving farmworkers.</p>
      <p>In 1990, a grant from the U.S. Department of Education to the Center for Documentary
        Studies at Duke funded college student volunteers documenting the lives of migrant
        farmworker children. Fourteen Duke students in the summer of 1990 and eleven more in 1991
        participated in the Center's Migrant Summer Program along with several University of North
        Carolina at Chapel Hill students. In 1992, students from Duke and UNC participated in a
        joint service-learning class about farmworker issues and the summer internship program.</p>
      <p>Inspired by other activists, a group of students enlisted farmworker advocates,
        farmworkers, and community members to incorporate SAF as a nonprofit in 1992. Since 1992,
        SAF has directly impacted thousands of farmworkers, students and community members</p>
      <p>As of 2007, the goals of SAF include:</p>
      <list type="ordered">
        <item>To provide farmworkers and their families with greater access to existing resources
          through collaborations with farmworker advocacy organizations and community groups</item>
        <item>To link student groups working with farmworkers in order to share their experiences
          and ideas</item>
        <item>To increase the involvement of farmworkers in leadership and decision-making roles
          within SAF and to encourage such involvement within other organizations working on
          farmworker issues</item>
        <item>To create a supportive environment for the efforts of farmworkers to improve their
          status in our society</item>
        <item>To create internships and other projects that are mutually beneficially for students
          and farmworkers</item>
        <item>To encourage student commitment to justice and social action</item>
        <item>To increase interaction, communication and understanding among people of different
          backgrounds</item>
        <item>To provide students from farmworker families with educational and career
          opportunities</item>
        <item>To provide information on farmworker issues for students, faculty, religious
          organizations, advocacy organizations, and community groups</item>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Founded in 1992 in Durham, North Carolina, Student Action with Farmworkers (SAF) is a
        non-profit organization whose mission is to bring students and farmworkers together to learn
        about each other's lives, share resources and skills, improve conditions for farmworkers,
        and build diverse coalitions working for social change. The SAF records comprise:
        correspondence; meeting agendas; student projects; reports, articles, and other
        publications; event files; teaching materials; photos; scrapbooks; ephemera; and other
        documentation of SAF's programs. Materials relate more widely to immigrant and migrant
        worker issues, service learning, labor organizing, and protests and boycotts across the U.S. </p>
      <p>The largest series (63 boxes) contains hundreds of individual SAF student projects directed
        by college-age students and interns as well as farmworker and migrant youths. Materials also
        include administrative files, many of which house intern applications. Project files
        typically contain recorded interviews, often with transcripts; essays; notebooks; artwork;
        poetry; audio and video recordings; theater materials; and photographs in analaog and
        digital formats. Some photograph albums and collages are also found here. Most of the
        projects took place in North Carolina but also in South Carolina. Umbrella programs include
        Into the Fields (ITF) and Levante. Major themes involve worker education, housing, health,
        and pesticide safety; leadership development; and grassroots theater as a tool for teaching
        and activism. Materials are in English and Spanish. Many other materials on SAF projects are
        found in the Administrative Series. </p>
      <p>The large Administrative Files Series contains organizational records created or compiled
        by SAF staff and are organized in subseries for SAF projects, fundraising, general
        administrative files, organizations, and resource files (articles, fliers, and other
        publications). </p>
      <p>The Printed Material Series contains Student Action with Farmworkers publications, SAF
        press coverage, student papers and theses, some children's books, and farmworker-related
        reports, articles, newsletters, data sheets, resource directories, and alerts from around
        the world. </p>
      <p>The Joan Preiss Papers Series contains records related to an activist and long-time
        collaborator of SAF. Comprises a variety of printed materials, primarily articles and
        newsletters, as well as correspondence, protest ephemera, promotional material for unions
        and activist organizations, meeting notes, student papers, and photographs. The materials
        relate to migrants and farmworkers both in North Carolina and throughout the United
        States.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Ephemera and Artifacts Series contains items such as posters, t-shirts,
        stickers, and buttons related to Burger King, Subway, Gallo, and Mt. Olive boycotts and
        protests. Some materials relate to protests and boycotts in other regions such as Florida
        and Western states. Also contains SAF publicity ephemera, and props and other materials from
        the Levante activist theater group.</p>
      <p>Acquired as part of the Human Rights Archive at Duke University.</p>

                celebration. Includes NC Farmworker Institute stakeholder session with the EPA. Also

                2014; questions focus on their methods of communication within the U.S., languages
                spoken other than Spanish (Mixtec, Nahuatal, Purépecha included among the answers),
                and what information they would be interested in receiving from SAF.</p>

              <p>Folders typically include staff meetings, staff retreats, and work-study
                applications. There are also a few recommendation files and a lobbying file. Other
                files related to staffing (correspondence, recommendations, events) can be found
                throughout the Administrative series, and in separate groupings such as
                Work-Study.</p>
              <p>Student administrative files associated with Into the Fields and other documentary
                projects are located in the Student Projects Series, though there may be some stray
                files in the larger Administrative Series.</p>

          <p>Series houses hundreds of files related to SAF's student-oriented documentary and
            leadership projects including AIM Farmworker Class, Into the Fields (ITF), and Levante.
            Some projects were created as part of Duke University Documentary Studies classes.
            Individual projects typically lasted one academic semester, one summer, or several
            weeks, and usually were carried out by one or two students.</p>
          <p>Materials in this series are divided into three subseries: student and intern
            applications, SAF project administrative files, and student documentary projects (the
            largest subgroup). </p>
          <p>The student and intern project files typically include a cover sheet, proposals,
            interview plans, essays or other narratives, creative writing, oral interviews,
            transcripts of interviews, digital and analog photographs, negatives, notebooks,
            handmade photograph albums, short videos, release forms signed by participants
            (interviewees), and other project materials. the release forms and other documentation
            ferquently include data on the migrants: ages, origination, and local addresses. </p>
          <p>Privacy laws govern these and other records. In addition, some projects include
            instructions banning the use of migrant names by request of the participants.</p>
          <p>Audiovisual/digital media have been removed to a separate series for preservation
            purposes. These may contain still images, document files, sound and video recordings,
            and artwork. Many folders contain transcripts or excerpts of interviews and printouts of
            photographs.</p>

            <p>Contains documentary projects created by SAF's Into the Fields interns and students,
              arranged by year; some groups are further arranged by student last name. The projects
              usually consist of paper records as well as audiovisual media, and may contain
              recorded interviews, interview transcripts, print and digital photos, and
              student/intern essays, blog posts, reflection notebooks, and occasional artwork.
              Interview materials are often in Spanish as well as English.</p>
            <p>Projects are centered around living and working conditions and social life in migrant
              farmworker communities. Many focus on aspects of folklife and the day-to-day lives of
              individuals. Multi-year ITF projects taken up by groups of students include
              "Recollections of Home" and "Folklife Documentary Projects." Each individual component
              project under these project umbrellas is individually foldered with the project title
              and student name(s).</p>
            <p>Audio, video, and digital media, chiefly containing recorded interviews, videos, and
              digital photographs, have been separated from the project papers for preservation
              reasons, and are located in the Audiovisual and Digital Materials subseries within the
              Student Project series. Additional materials were often posted by the interns and
              students to online repositories administered by SAF but may not be present in this
              collection.</p>

              <p>Into the Fields projects, arranged by last name of students or interns, typically
                consist of materials related to interviewing farmworkers and their families, and
                documenting living and working conditions. Folders can include transcripts of
                interviews, reflections on the interview process, photocopy reproductions or
                original photographic prints, and hard copies of blog posts written by the interns.
                Audiovisual media (CDs and DVDs) accompany many of the projects, and may contain
                still images, sound, and moving image formats.</p>

          <p>Contains Student Action with Farmworkers (SAF) publications, press coverage, and
            publicity, as well as a rich collection of publications originating from local,
            regional, and national organizations. Many of these were housed in binders and resource
            files in SAF's offices.</p>
          <p>Formats include articles, reports, data sheets, directories, clippings, newsletters,
            and ephemeral publications (fliers, brochures) related to farmworker and migrant labor
            issues. There are also a handful of student theses, and a selection of children's books.
            Many of the items are English and Spanish bilingual publications.</p>
          <p>Arranged by title; most pieces are individually foldered but there are also collections
            of similar materials grouped in folders with general titles.</p>
          <p>Additional print materials are found in the Administrative Files series, where there
            are resource files and print materials related to events, protests, teaching, and
            organizations. Some are also found in the Ephemera series.</p>

            <p>Big Papa is a puppet that was used by SAF's theater group from 2003-2004 to represent
              the negative aspects of corporate agriculture. The puppet was created by NC sculpture
              artist Daniel L. Mathewson (1964-2011) for the play <emph render="italic">Gigantes en
                los Campos/Giants in the Fields</emph> written by NC writer Cara Page. The Big Papa
              character had few lines, but loomed ominously over scenes in the play as a method of
              intimidation and mockery of the farmworker characters. The play critiqued the H2A
              Guestworker Program which brings thousands of farmworkers to labor in the fields of
              North Carolina picking tobacco, cucumbers and other crops.</p>
