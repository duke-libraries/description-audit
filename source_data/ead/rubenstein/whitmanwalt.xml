      <abstract id="aspace_d47af43e583bad18ac5a21e67278ef38">Collection includes correspondence
        separated into two subseries: "Letters To or About Walt Whitman," and "Letters From or By
        Walt Whitman." Most of Whitman's letters in the collection were written between 1880 and
        1891. Letters include those written to and from friends, family members, editors,
        publishers, and soldiers Whitman met in and around Washington, D. C. during the Civil War.
        The Clippings Series includes both large groups of clippings collected and annotated by
        Whitman, and clippings Whitman took from complete or nearly complete articles. Also included
        are manuscripts and printed materials about or relating to Whitman, most of which date
        during Whitman's lifetime. There are portraits, etchings, engravings, and sketches both of
        Whitman and of his brother, George, and sister, Hannah. A Writings Series contains
        manuscript and printed versions of poetry and prose dating from Whitman's career in
        journalism up to the end of his life. It is divided into four subseries: Manuscript Poems
        (1855-1882 and undated); Manuscript Prose (1852-1891 and undated); Proofs (1874-1891 and
        undated); and Periodicals Containing Contributions by Whitman (1841-1891).</abstract>

      <head>Provenance</head>
      <p>The bulk of Duke University's Walt Whitman holdings were acquired through a series of
        substantial donations made by Dr. and Mrs. Josiah C. Trent. Much of the Trent material was
        originally gathered by Richard Maurice Bucke, Whitman's friend and literary executor, who
        sold manuscript versions of his biography of Whitman, along with his collection of
        unpublished letters and Whitman's personal papers and books, in London in 1935. The next
        year, Jacob Schwartz offered for sale in New York a large portion of the Whitman holdings
        that had belonged to Bucke, and many of the items listed in the catalogue of this sale were
        a part of the original donation made to Duke by Dr. and Mrs. Trent in 1942. The Trent family
        made several important additions to their initial bequest in the years following the
        establishment of the collection, but Duke University does not expect its Whitman manuscript
        holdings to expand at any time in the near future.</p>

      <p>The <emph render="bold">Walt Whitman papers</emph> incorporates material spanning the dates
        1841-1940, with the bulk of the material dating from 1841-1891. The virtual reorganization
        of the collection, based upon that devised by Ellen F. Frey in <title type="simple"
          render="italic">A Bibliography of Walt Whitman</title> (Port Washington, NY: Kennikat
        Press, 1945), divides it into six series: <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph>, <emph
          render="bold">Writings</emph>, <emph render="bold">Clippings</emph>, <emph render="bold"
          >Material About or Relating to Whitman</emph>, <emph render="bold">Portraits</emph>, and
          <emph render="bold">Miscellany</emph>.</p>
      <p>Items marked as unavailable are currently missing. </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> is separated into two subseries: "Letters To or
        About Walt Whitman," and "Letters From or By Walt Whitman." Most of Whitman's letters in the
        collection were written between 1880 and 1891. The <emph render="bold">Clippings
          Series</emph> lists both large groups of clippings collected and annotated by Whitman, and
        clippings Whitman took from complete or nearly complete articles. Whenever possible, these
        have been dated according to the periodical in which the articles originally appeared. <emph
          render="bold">Material About or Relating to Whitman</emph> is comprised of subseries that
        catalog manuscript versions of Richard Maurice Bucke's biography of Whitman, as well as
        other manuscript material written by Whitman or recorded by his friends. The <emph
          render="bold">Portraits Series</emph> includes formal photographic and painted portraits,
        etchings, engravings, and sketches, both of Whitman and of his brother, George, and sister,
        Hannah. The <emph render="bold">Miscellany</emph> consists of ephemera related to Whitman's
        life and career as a poet. Two scrapbooks, book wrappers for the first edition of <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Leaves of Grass,</title> and documents relating to the
        Whitman fund are listed among this series' eclectic contents.</p>
      <p>By far the largest series in the collection, the <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph>
        contains manuscript and printed versions of poetry and prose dating from Whitman's career in
        journalism to the end of his life. It is divided into four subseries: Manuscript Poems
        (1855-1882 and undated); Manuscript Prose (1852-1891 and undated); Proofs (1874-1891 and
        undated); and Periodicals Containing Contributions by Whitman (1841-1891). The first
        subseries, "Manuscript Poems," is further subdivided into categories intended to define
        three separate levels of poetic composition: manuscript versions of poems that appear in at
        least one edition of Leaves of Grass, manuscript versions of poems not published in Leaves
        of Grass, and verse fragments and outlines. The researcher is advised to consult the NYU
          <title type="simple" render="italic">Collected Writings of Walt Whitman,</title>
        particularly Harold W. Blodgett and Sculley Bradley, eds., <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Leaves of Grass: A Comprehensive Reader's Edition</title> (New York: NYUP,
        1965), pp. 585-706, for publication of previously uncollected material. Although older,
        Oscar Lovell Triggs, ed., <title type="simple" render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title> by
        Walt Whitman, vol. 3 of 10 (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902) and Clarence Gohdes and
        Rollo G. Silver, eds., <title type="simple" render="italic">Faint Clews and Indirections:
          Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</title> (Durham, NC: Duke UP, 1949) are also
        helpful, the former particularly when used alongside Frey's Bibliography.</p>
      <p>The Manuscript Prose Subseries in the <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph> is further
        divided into seven categories. The first three are comprised of manuscript versions of
        stories, prefaces, and essays and lectures, respectively. Four less distinct subheadings
        follow. "Notes on Literature" represents an almost exact transliteration of Frey's category
        of the same name, however it should be noted that this category does not, at the time of
        writing, list all of Trent's holdings in Whitman's literary-critical manuscripts. Some
        literary criticism is contained in "Autobiographical Manuscripts" and "Whitman on His Own
        Writings," along with more purely impressionistic self-reflection. "Miscellany" should also
        be consulted, as it brings together in an unsystematic way Whitman's notes on travel,
        reading, and education as well as a scattering of notes on poetry and different forms of
        literary production.</p>
      <p>The last two subseries of the <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph> bring together
        various published versions of Whitman's writing. Annotated proofs of his poetry and prose
        are identified in the finding aid, and cross-references are included between the Proofs
        Subseries and the Periodicals Containing Contributions by Whitman Subseries in instances
        where the collection lists both a proof and a published version of a poem or article among
        its headings. The Periodicals Containing Contributions by Whitman Subseries provides a
        survey of his writing during his lifetime. </p>
      <p>Many published works by and about Walt Whitman and housed in the David M. Rubenstein Rare
        Book &amp; Manuscript Library have been cataloged individually. These can be found by
        searching the Duke online catalog.</p>

            <p>Contains letters by friends and family members, editors, publishers, and soldiers. As
              with the Correspondence to or about Whitman Subseries, many letters in this subseries
              are bound with other material and the reference archivist should be contacted before
              correspondence is requested in bulk. Most of Whitman's letters in the Trent Collection
              date from 1880 to 1891.</p>
