         <head>Biographical and Historical Note</head>
         <p>Born in Atlanta, Georgia on September 21, 1917, Charles DeWitt Watts was a pioneering
            African American surgeon. Watts graduated from Morehouse College with a degree in
            mathematics in 1938. He received his medical degree in 1943 from Howard University
            College of Medicine in Washington, D.C., where he was mentored by Dr. Charles R. Drew, a
            pioneer of blood collection and plasma processing. Watts completed his surgical training
            at Freedman's Hospital in Washington, D.C. from 1943-1948 and worked at Howard as
            instructor of surgery and director of the cancer clinic from 1948-1949.</p>
         <p>In 1945, Watts married Constance Merrick Watts, the granddaughter of North Carolina
            Mutual Life Insurance Company founders, John Merrick and Dr. A.M. Moore. They had four
            children. In 1950, the Watts family returned to Constance's hometown of Durham, North
            Carolina, where Watts set up a private practice and joined the staff of Lincoln
            Hospital. He was the first African American to be certified by a surgical specialty
            board in North Carolina. During his medical career, he served as Director of Student
            Health at North Carolina Central University (1952-1960), Chief of Surgery at Lincoln
            Hospital (1965-1976), Attending Surgeon at Watts Hospital (1968-1976) and Durham County
            General Hospital (1976-1987), and Adjunct Clinical Professor of Surgery at Duke. He
            retired from private practice in 1988 but continued to consult and teach.</p>
         <p>Watts worked for civil rights and quality medical care for Durham residents. He was one
            of the founders and served on the Board of Durham County General Hospital (now Durham
            Regional Hospital), the first desegregated hospital in Durham. When Lincoln Hospital
            closed its doors after the opening of Durham Regional, Watts was instrumental in turning
            it into the Lincoln Community Health Center, an outpatient clinic dedicated to serving
            Durham residents regardless of income; he served as its first Medical Director for a
            year until Dr. Evie Schmidt was hired as its permanent head. Watts also served as
            Vice-President and Medical Director of the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company
            from 1960-1988. From 1978-1993, he was a trustee of Howard University, where he oversaw
            the university's medical enterprise and engineered the Board's governance reform. In
            2002, Duke University Medical School created the Charles Watts Travel Award to help fund
            faculty and student travel to study culturally specific issues. Charles DeWitt Watts
            passed away in Durham on July 12, 2004 at the age of 86.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Spanning the dates 1917 to 2004, the Charles DeWitt Watts Papers contain files related
            to Watts's education, family, community activities, centered in Durham, N.C., and his
            career as a surgeon, administrator, and trustee on several boards. The bulk of the
            material dates from 1970 to 2000. The collection primarily consists of correspondence,
            reports, notes, speeches, photographs, and print materials, and is organized into the
            following series: <emph render="bold">Community Relations, Personal Files, Photographic
               Materials</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Professional Files</emph>. Material
            containing personally-identifiable medical information in the <emph render="bold"
               >Medical Records Series</emph> has been separated from the other professional files
            and is currently closed to use.</p>
         <p>Largest in the collection is the Professional Files Series, which primarily contains
            administrative documents related to Watts's career as a doctor, surgeon, and medical
            administrator for various private practices, hospitals, boards, and professional
            societies. Of particular note are files related to Watt's mentor, Dr. Charles Drew, the
            history of Lincoln Hospital, and the establishment of the Lincoln Community Health
            Center in 1970. The folders in the Medical Records Series have been segregated and are
            currently closed to use. The Community Relations Series concerns Watts's professional
            life outside of medicine, containing files related to his membership in churches and
            fraternal organizations, non-medically-related boards on which he served, his work with
            Durham, N.C. organizations, his interest in race relations, and honors awarded him. Also
            included are the papers of Constance Watts (wife), Lyda Merrick (mother-in-law), and
            Margaret Smith (a nurse in his office). Of special interest is a scrapbook about the
               <emph render="italic">Negro Braille Magazine</emph> (now the <emph render="italic"
               >Merrick-Washington Magazine for the Blind</emph>), founded by Mrs. Merrick.</p>
         <p>Some professional correspondence is also intermixed in the Personal Files Series, which
            contains papers related to Watts's family, friends, finances, education, and alumni
            activities. Of particular note is a transcript of Watts's oral history. Containing both
            professional and personal content, the Photographic Materials Series contains
            photographs, slides, and negatives. The bulk consists of portraits and snapshots of the
            Watts family. Of particular note are early photographs of Lincoln Hospital nursing
            students and staff members.</p>

                  societies. Topics include minority healthcare, minority physicians, healthcare
                  cost containment, national health insurance, substance abuse, and child sexual
                  abuse. Of particular note are files related to the history of Lincoln Hospital,
                  the establishment of the Lincoln Clinic, and to Watts's mentor, Dr. Charles Drew.
                  Materials include budgets, planning documents, correspondence, reports, memos,
                  pamphlets, meeting materials, printed materials, policies, grant proposals, event
                  programs, financial statements, CVs, and notes on medical procedures. Files are
                  grouped by the following topics and then arranged chronologically: Durham County
                  General Hospital, Howard University, Lincoln Hospital/Clinic, North Carolina
                  Mutual Life Insurance Co., and Professional Societies and Task Forces. Files that
                  fall outside of these groupings are arranged alphabetically at the end of the
                  series. Some additional professional files can be found in the Personal Files
                  Series.</p>
