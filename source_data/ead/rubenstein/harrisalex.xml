      <abstract id="aspace_f6986494dd51af3e58920133fa4056ec">Alex Harris is a documentary
        photographer, author, and professor emeritus at the Center for Documentary Studies in
        Durham, North Carolina. The subjects in the over 600 black-and-white and color photographs
        that span his career include the landscapes and peoples of Alaska, the American South and
        New Mexico, and Cuba; subjects in other documentary projects include portraits of older
        reading volunteers and students in Philadelphia, students on strike at Yale University,
        counter-culture people at a Rainbow Gathering in Arizona, a boy tethered to electronic
        technology, elderly people living on their own; and the interior of author Reynolds Price's
        home. The gelatin silver and inkjet prints range in size from 8x10 inch reference prints to
        24x36 inch exhibit prints. Harris's professional papers document his collaborations with
        other photographers and writers on books and exhibitions, including anthropologist Gertrude
        Duby Blom, naturalist E.O. Wilson, and South African photographers; they also cover his long
        career at Duke University, as teacher, author, and co-founder of the Center for Documentary
        Studies and its publication, <title render="italic">DoubleTake</title>. In addition to the
        paper records, there are many recorded oral histories and interviews. Acquired as part of
        the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The over 600 black-and-white and color photographs in the collection date from Harris's
        earliest photographic work as a graduate student at Yale University, to his more recent work
        documenting the American South. The subjects range widely, and include the landscapes and
        peoples of Alaska, the American South and New Mexico, and Cuba; they also include portraits
        of older reading volunteers and students in Philadelphia, students on strike at Yale
        University, counter-culture people at a Rainbow Gathering in Arizona, a boy going about his
        day, tethered to electronic technology, elderly people living on their own in central North
        Carolina, and views of the art-filled interiors of author Reynolds Price's home. The gelatin
        silver and inkjet prints range in size from 8x10 inch reference prints to 24x36 inch exhibit
        prints; for large prints there are smaller viewing copies to facilitate research access. </p>
      <p>The remaining series house Harris's papers, which document collaborations with other
        photographers and writers, including Gertrude Duby Blom and E.O. Wilson, and South Africa
        photographers; they also document his career at Duke University as a teacher, author, and
        co-founder of the Center for Documentary Studies (CDS) and its serial publication, <title
          render="italic">DoubleTake</title>. The <emph render="bold">Publicity and Audiovisual
          Materials Series</emph> contains recordings of lectures as well as publicity for exhibits
        and publications. The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> includes not only
        Harris's exchanges with other photographers, friends, and professionals, but also grant
        applications, research notes, drafts and proofs, print materials, and some photographs. The
          <emph render="bold">DoubleTake</emph> files consist mainly of materials generated during
        the planning stages and early years of the magazine's existence. Materials on Harris's
        extensive collaborations on other publications, documentary projects, and related
        exhibitions make up the large <emph render="bold">Project Files Series</emph>, which
        includes many oral histories and interviews related to his projects, mostly on cassette
        tapes (use copies must be made for access). The <emph render="bold">Teaching Materials
          Series</emph> comprises syllabi, student writings and slides, and other materials from
        classes taught by Harris mainly through the CDS at Duke University. Finally, the <emph
          render="bold">Proof Prints Series</emph> contains a small number of proof prints related
        to various projects.</p>

          <p>These black-and-white photographs have as their subjects Eskimos and Inuit elders and
            their day-to-day lives in small Alaskan communities. The images were taken over the
            course of multiple trips over a five-year period in the 1970s in villages along the
            Kobuk River, located above the Arctic Circle, and in fishing villages along the southern
            coast of the Bering Sea in Alaska. The project provided documentary images for a study
            conducted by Robert Coles, supported by the non-profit Commonwealth Fund, and published
            in the book, <title render="italic">The Last and First Eskimos</title> (1978). Consists
            of 50 11x14 inch prints, and six 16x20 inch prints, all in gelatin silver format. Titles
            assigned by photographer.</p>

          <p>Series contains 38 24x30 inch color images taken in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North
            Carolina, and South Carolina. Photographed from 1984-1985, the subjects are small towns
            and cities, with their modest houses, gas stations, parking lots, tobacco warehouses,
            malls, storefronts, usually unpopulated but with old cars and trucks often appearing in
            the frame. Many of the locations are in Durham, North Carolina; other cities include
            (but are not limited to) Wilmington, Wake Forest, and Norlina, North Carolina;
            Birmingham, Alabama; Monroe, Bastrop, and Raysville, Louisiana; Summerton, St. Helena's
            Island, and Charleston, South Carolina; and Hinesville, Sunbury, and Stone Mountain,
            Georgia. The project was funded by an award from the Lyndhurst Foundation. Titles
            assigned by photographer.</p>

          <p>Representing some of Harris's earliest work, this project was an initiative of the
            Institute of Policy Sciences and Public Affairs at Duke University and started as a
            photographic study of substandard housing and living conditions in the state. Featured
            are portraits of North Carolinians and scenes from rural locations from counties in the
            eastern, central and western regions. There are portraits of people of all ages and
            races, and are shown in front of their dwellings; working, chiefly at agricultural
            tasks; and relaxing by pitching horseshoes. A number of them are of migrant workers.
            Fifty-six black-and-white 17x22 inch digital prints. </p>
          <p>In 1972, a selection of these photographs was exhibited at University of North Carolina
            Symposium on the South, "The Mind of the South and The Southern Soul" as well as at the
            Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art. In 1978, ten of these photographs were also
            published in <title render="italic">I Shall Save One Land Unvisited</title> by Jonathan
            Williams, and were part of a traveling exhibition opening at the Corcoran that same
            year. </p>
          <p>Eleven other exhibit prints, printed in 2015 for the exhibition "Where We Live: A North
            Carolina Portrait," are housed in this collection.</p>
          <p>Titles assigned by photographer.</p>

          <p>This series of color photographs features the artist's son, Will, playing his Game Boy
            in a variety of public, private, and natural settings. The project took shape from the
            artist's observation in the 1990s that children were becoming increasingly attached to
            hand-held, portable electronic gaming devices; it explores the implications of how
            pre-adolescent interaction with electronics might bear out on post-adolescent human
            interaction and relationships. Smaller reference copies for the 22 large 20x24 inch
            inkjet prints are available and are preferred for research access. Titles assigned by
            photographer.</p>

          <p>Alex Harris's earliest work in the collection consists of 12 black-and-white 16x20 inch
            digital prints of student demonstrations at Yale University. The demonstrations came in
            response to the arrest of Black Panther Party leader, Bobby Seale, who was accused of
            ordering the murder of a supposed police informant in New Haven. The series documents
            the demonstrations from a variety of angles and includes images of National Guard
            soldiers, students, and university officials. These images remained unprinted for almost
            37 years until they were published as part of a Duke University exhibition of Harris's
            early work. Titles assigned by photographer.</p>

          <p>After a shoot in New Mexico in the 1970s, Harris returned there in the 1980s, visiting
            familiar locations in the High Road area he had photographed earlier. Specific locations
            include Chamisal, El Valle, Las Trampas, Las Vegas (NM), Peñasco, Rio Lucio, Truchas,
            and Vallecito. Scenes include snow on the high plains, horses, towns and streets, and
            people of various ages. One series of images was taken on the Picuris Native American
            reservation. Other images feature the colorful interiors of houses, which offer a
            glimpse into the intimate spaces and folk culture of the inhabitants. Some outdoor
            locations such as nightclubs and streets are viewed through a car windshield,
            foreshadowing images from the trip to Cuba in 1998. Digital pigmented color prints
            measure 20x24 inches, with the exception of two 16x20 prints, and were printed in 2000.
            There is a mock-up for the book related to these images in the Project Files series.
            Titles assigned by photographer.</p>

          <p>Subjects of these images from 1970s trips to New Mexico include old men and women,
            youthful members of a gang, girls celebrating their first communion, and beauty queens.
            Locations - both with and without people - include natural areas such as streams and
            forests, as well as farms, house interiors, streets, festivals, and outdoor work
            locations. Specific communities include Arroyo Hondo, Chamisal, Chimayo, El Valle, Las
            Trampas, Peñasco, Truchas, and Vallecito. The 42 gelatin silver prints are sized 11x14
            (29) and 16x20 inches (13), and were printed in 1999 and 2000. Titles assigned by
            photographer.</p>

          <p>Taken over the span of roughly one year, these images dwell on aspects of life for an
            elderly farmer, Jacobo Romero, part of the Hispanic community of northern New Mexico.
            "River of Traps" refers to the river, Rio de las Trampas, which runs through this area.
            Romero is shown chiefly on his farm, working cattle, irrigating, and harvesting hay, and
            in arroyos and other natural areas where he treks to look for wood and foraged food.
            There are also images of his wife, his grandchildren, and friends. This project provided
            documentary images for a book by the same name, with text by William deBuys (1990). Some
            of the images also appear in a book by Robert Coles, <title render="italic">The Old Ones
              of New Mexico</title> (1973). The 30 gelatin silver prints measure 11x14 (20) and
            16x20 inches (10), and were printed in 1999 and 2000. Titles assigned by
            photographer.</p>

          <p>While in New Mexico in 1979, Harris traveled to the nearby Rainbow Gathering, an annual
            counter-culture festival and encampment. There, he photographed men, women, and
            children, many of them nude, as they danced, built fires, told stories, bathed, and
            played instruments. The 11 gelatin silver images measure 11x14 (9) and 16x20 inches (2),
            and were printed in 1999-2000. Titles assigned by photographer.</p>

          <p>These black-and-white images were taken by Harris in May 1999 as part of an assignment
            to document interactions between volunteer reading tutors over the age of 55 and
            elementary school students in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Experience Corps is
            currently sponsored by the U.S. organization AARP. Most of the subjects, including
            volunteers, are African American. Gelatin silver prints measure 11x14 inches. Harris
            continued this work until 2005, with many later images taken in color. A selection of
            images was exhibited in the U.S. Senate Russell Building Rotunda in July 2005. Titles
            assigned by photographer.</p>

              render="italic">Why We Are Here: Mobile and the Spirit of a Southern City</title>
            (2012). The prints were part of an exhibit in the Mobile Museum of Art from October

            scenes; Mardi Gras events, including balls and receptions; and landscapes, including
            images of the Gulf of Mexico and of local and state parklands. Includes a portrait of
            naturalist E.O. Wilson, kneeling down to look at ants. Titles assigned by
            photographer.</p>
          <p>The 69 prints measure 24x30 inches and were made on an Epson 7900 stylus pro, using
            Epson ultrachrome hdr inks.</p>

          <p>The series contains 61 17x24 inch color inkjet prints of interior views of the former
            home of author Reynolds Price, a friend of the photographer, taken in 2011 after Price's
            death. There are also 61 jpeg files of the images, and a print essay by Harris. Images
            include views of rooms with numerous artworks and closeups of individual art pieces in
            Price's house. The photographs were published in <title render="italic">Dream of a
              House</title> (2017). Titles assigned by photographer.</p>
          <p>Artist's abstract: "My wife Margaret Sartor and I were friends with Reynolds Price as
            well as his relatively close neighbors. Over the years, we visited Reynolds many times
            in his home on Cornwallis Road in Durham. We marveled as his collections grew,
            particularly after he was confined to a wheelchair in 1984 until his death in 2011. That
            spring of 2011, I was asked to document Reynolds' home before it was dismantled.
            Initially I made these photographs as a collection for the Archive of Documentary Arts
            to accompany the Reynolds Price Archive at Rubenstein. But after making the pictures,
            along with Margaret I began to see connections between the man, his writing, and the
            collections in his home."</p>

            <p>A group of eight recordings, six of which document meetings and retreats conducted in
              the early 1990s to discuss creation of the magazine eventually known as <title

              feature Robert Coles discussing the Center for Documentary Studies. No transcripts
              have been discovered, but material on the early history of the magazine is present in
              this collection. Several tapes may derive from the same meeting at Quail Roost Retreat
              in 1993, although with slight variations in labeling and dating. Tapes are arranged
              chronologically. "MC" denotes microcassettes, "C," audiocassettes.</p>

            <p>Audiocassettes and micro cassettes of interviews with many of the twenty
              photographers represented in the Rubenstein Library's South African Documentary
              Photography Collection, curated by Alex Harris during his work on the project "South
              Africa: The Cordoned Heart," which resulted in a book published in 1986. Interviews
              were conducted mainly by Alex Harris and Margaret Sartor. The tapes are mainly
              undated, but transcripts place them between October 1985 and July 1986. Also includes
              presentations by Alex Harris and Bruce Payne and others.</p>
            <p>There are fifteen microcassettes and six audiocassettes in this group, arranged in
              order by last name, then by date. Unidentified tapes are at the end. Includes a set of
              four cassettes from a Cordoned Heart symposium, 1986. "MC" denotes microcassettes,
              "C," audiocassettes. Since the transcripts contain little or no reference to the tape
              numbering scheme, an individual transcript cannot be assumed to contain all
              appearances of an individual on various tapes. Transcripts are housed in the
              Correspondence Series under "South Africa--Transcripts."</p>
