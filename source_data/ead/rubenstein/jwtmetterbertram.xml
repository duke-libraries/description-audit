            marketing operation. He also served as a primary on the Ford account, during which time
            he directed print and television promotion for Ford and played a key role in the
            launching of several new car models. The Bertram Metter Papers span 1908 to 2000, with

         <p>After Burton J. Manning, Metter became only the second creative director at JWT to rise
            to the level of Chairman, Board of Directors. In the midst of a management crisis that
            hit the financially ailing company, Metter resigned in 1987. Metter was rehired as
            Chairman in 1988; his primary tasks were to coordinate new business efforts for JWT USA,
            provide additional strategic advice for ongoing accounts, and focus on general
            management and creative troubleshooting.</p>
         <p>During his time with JWT, Metter won numerous creative awards, including Clios, Cannes
            Film Festival awards, <emph render="italic">Advertising Age</emph> 100 Best TV
            Commercials, and others. He published several articles about the advertising business in

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Bertram Metter Papers span 1908 to 2000, with the bulk of the collection dating 1953
            through the late 1980s. The collection includes materials in a variety of formats,
            including correspondence, writings, newspaper and magazine clippings, sheet music,
            printed materials, photographs, and photostats, that document Metter's thirty years in
            advertising and marketing, with a focus on his career as a copywriter, creative
            director, and Vice Chairman at J. Walter Thompson USA (JWT). The collection provides a
            record of Metter's early work as a <emph render="doublequote">direct response
               specialist</emph> for the Ford Motor Company direct marketing operation, and other
            roles on the Ford account (Metter directed print and television promotion for Ford and
            played a key role in the launching of several new car models). In addition to Ford
            materials, the collection documents Metter's work for other major clients, including the
            Pepsi-Cola Company (Mexico) and Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company. While the bulk of
            the collection consists of advertising and marketing research, client reports and
            correspondence, promotional materials, and other professional files, the collection also
            contains materials related to Metter's later work as a consultant and author, including
            drafts of an unpublished book manuscript entitled <title type="simple"
               render="doublequote">Breaking the Rules at J. Walter Thompson,</title> a chronicle of
            his career at JWT. </p>
         <p>The collection is organized into four series: <emph render="bold">Professional
               Files</emph>, <emph render="bold">Writings</emph>, <emph render="bold">Ford Motor
               Company Account Files</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Other Clients</emph>.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Professional Files Series</emph> contains JWT office
            (non-client) files, memoranda, and publications; industry publications and press
            clippings; overviews of Metter's professional biography; and limited files on Metter's
            consulting work for Ross Roy Advertising. The <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph>
            contains Metter's writings on the advertising industry; bulk of series is composed of an
            unpublished book manuscript entitled <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Breaking
               the Rules at J. Walter Thompson,</title> comprised primarily of chapter drafts and
            research. The <emph render="bold">Ford Series</emph>, the largest series in the
            collection, includes materials relating to the launch and promotion of new models
            (Escort, Maverick, Mustang, Olympic, Pinto, Thunderbird, and Torino); marketing research
            and strategic reports; Ford direct mail materials and newsletters; television commercial
