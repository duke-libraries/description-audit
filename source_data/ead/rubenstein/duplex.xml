         <head>Processing Information</head>
         <p>The collection arrived largely arranged according to format, ranging from photographs,
            negatives, slides to printed materials. The photographs were arranged in two ways: 1)
            alphabetically (for the most part) by client, and 2) by product type. The majority of
            negatives were already sleeved and labeled, and are listed in the box list. There were a
            number of negatives in their original paper sleeves, or loose in envelopes. These items
            were placed in paper negative sleeves and labeled as best they could be. The slides were
            organized by varying topic: some are categorized by product/client name (Budweiser,
            Coke, etc.); while some are arranged by product type (automobiles); and some are under
            other categories including Construction and Miscellaneous. These various organizational
            models were retained in processing of the slides. The printed material was simply placed
            in folders and labeled.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>
            <emph render="bold">The Duplex Advertising Company. Billboard Images and Records</emph>
            spans the period 1964-1993 and documents the outdoor advertising work of this company in
            the central Texas area, primarily through photographs, negatives and slides of
            billboards. Many of the images are in color. A large number of the images are of
            national campaigns advertised in central Texas, as well as billboards, signs and posters
            of local Texas business services. In addition, a handful of articles written by R. V.
            Miller, Jr. for a number of publications, as well as other printed material and
            miscellaneous items from the Duplex Advertising Company, are present. Some of these
            articles, along with the images themselves, provide examples of commercial art and
            design in the outdoor advertising arena. The collection includes outdoor advertising
            images from national clients such as Kentucky Fried Chicken, Chevrolet, Coca Cola,
            Coors, Wendy's, Hardee's, and Taco Bell, and Texas clients such as Lone Star and Pearl
            beers. </p>
         <p>Related materials may be found in other outdoor advertising collections, including the
            Outdoor Advertising Association of America Archives, the Garrett Orr Papers, the Howard
            Scott Papers, the John Paver Papers, the John E. Browning Papers, the R.C. Maxwell Co.
