         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection is composed of 33 pocket diaries Parker Pillsbury kept for the years 1864
            to 1896. The diaries contain a consistent, uninterrupted record of Pillsbury's life
            during these years. </p>
         <p>Pillsbury wrote daily or nearly daily about the details of his life recording both the
            mundane and the profound. A typical entry begins with the weather and his location
            before providing the names of those with whom he met or correspondeded that day, events
            he attended, lectures he gave, or work he did. Pillsbury writes about his interactions
            with William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, Abby Kelley and Stephen S. Foster,
            Gerrit Smith, Wendell Phillips, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott,
            the Allcott family, Robert Ingersoll, Charles Sumner, Henry Ward Beecher, Theodore
            Tilton and many other leading social reformers of the nineteenth century. His entries
            are occasionally accompanied by tipped in newspaper clippings about national events.</p>
         <p>Due to their consistency and span, the diaries provide a decades' long chronology of
            Pillsbury's involvement with and importance in the major social reform movements of the
            late nineteenth century, and in particular, the women's rights movement with which he
            closely associated during these years. The diaries show him to be a ceaseless traveler,
            moving up and down the east coast, throughout New England, and through western New York
            and the Midwest, as he lectured, preached, attended women's suffrage conventions, and
            otherwise attempted to advance the causes of equal rights for women and African
            Americans and Free Religion. </p>
         <p>The diaries illustrate his close and sustained relationship with major figures in the
            women's rights movements. He writes of his work as joint editor with Elizabeth Cady
            Stanton and Susan B. Anthony of the Revolution from 1867 to 1870, and his continued
            friendship and partnership with Anthony in the following decades. He often visited her
            in Rochester, they lectured together, and he served as her advisor when she was put on
            trial in Albany by the State Supreme Court for voting without the right to do so.</p>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Parker Pillsbury (September 22, 1809 – July 7, 1898) was an American minister, lecturer,
            newspaper editor, and advocate for abolition and women's rights. He was born in
            Hamilton, Massachusetts, the son of Oliver Pillsbury, a blacksmith and farmer, and Anna
            (Smith) Pillsbury. He was a descendant of William Pillsbury who came to Massachusetts
            circa 1640. Parker’s parents moved to Henniker, New Hampshire in 1814. He was educated
            in the district school and worked on farms in New Hampshire and as a wagoner in
            Massachusetts. From 1835 to 1838, he studied at the Gilmanton Theological Seminary, and
            then for a year at the more conservative Andover Theological Seminary. By the time
            Pillsbury left Andover he was a devout Abolitionist. He briefly held a parish position
            at the Congregational Church at Loudon, New Hampshire, however his Congregational
            license to preach was revoked in 1840 because of his use of the pulpit to denounce
            slavery. Though he held no regular pastorate, he continued to preach for free religious
            societies in Toledo, Ohio, Battle Creek, Michigan, Rochester, New York and elsewhere. On
            January 1, 1840, he married fellow abolitionist Sarah H. Sargent of Concord, New
            Hampshire.</p>
         <p>Pillsbury was an abolitionist of the Garrisonian type, and from 1840 until the
            emancipation of the slaves was lecture agent for the New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and
            American anti-slavery societies. An admirer of John Brown, he spoke at a demonstration
            meeting in Rochester, New York following Brown’s execution. In 1840 and again in 1845-46
            he edited the Herald of Freedom, at Concord, New Hampshire, and from January to May 1866
            the National Anti-Slavery Standard, in New York City. After the Civil War he was active
            in efforts to procure the right of suffrage for African Americans believing that the
            right to vote was necessary for their protection. He was also interested in temperance,
            political reform, international peace, and women’s rights. </p>
         <p>Pillsbury was one of the earliest and most devoted advocates women's rights in the
            nineteenth century. He severed his connection with the Standard when its managers showed
            themselves more favorable toward extending the right to vote to African Americans than
            to women. He was a long time vice-president of the New Hampshire Woman Suffrage
            Association and helped draft the constitution of the American Equal Rights Association.
            From 1868 to 1870, he was joint editor with Elizabeth Cady Stanton of the Revolution, a
            radical weekly. In addition to contributions to these newspapers, he wrote the Acts of
            the Anti-Slavery Apostles (1883), a history of the abolition movement in New
            England.</p>
