         <p>Will Inman was a poet, essayist, editor, and publisher. He was born William Archibald
            McGirt, Jr. in Wilmington, North Carolina where his father, William A. McGirt, was in
            the insurance and real estate business and his mother, Delia E. McGirt (maiden name
            Inman), was a registered nurse. He attended Duke University, graduating with an A.B in
            1943. After college, Inman worked as a union organizer for tobacco workers in North
            Carolina before moving to New York City in the late 1950s. He served as the
            Vice-president of Free University of New York in the mid 1960s. He has worked as an
            editor and publisher of various literary journals and has had his work published in
            numerous anthologies and literary journals as well as in individual volumes. His weekly
            column, <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Conchsound in the Hills,</title> was
            published in the Franklin, PA <title type="simple" render="italic">News-Herald
            </title>in the 1960s. In addition to writing poetry, fiction, plays, and essays, Inman
            was also a prolific correspondent and diarist. He was active in numerous causes,
            including the War in Vietnam, the Civil Rights movement, gay rights, and various
            environmental issues. In 1956, he was questioned by the House Un-American Activities
            Committee as to his relationship with the Communist Party. His activism continued into
            the 1990s; he led writing workshops in an Arizona State Prison, as well as teaching
            writing to the homeless in transition.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The correspondence, diaries, manuscripts, clippings, and printed material in the Will
            Inman Papers span from 1939-1999, and serve to document the life and literary career of
            the poet, essayist, editor, educator, and publisher.</p>
         <p>Inman was a prolific corespondent and maintained regular correspondent relationships
            with his friends and family, as well as with his readers and other editors and authors.
            He also regularly wrote to political and social figures during the 1960s. These letters
            to public and political figures express admiration and voice concerns about political
            events and social conditions. Inman protested in favor of civil rights, ending the war
            in Vietnam, and various environmental causes, and his letters reflect his thoughts and
            opinions on these subjects. Inman was also in regular contact with the editors and
            publishers of various literary magazines and the letters to these individuals document
            his efforts to publish his work. The collection holds many of Inman's out going
            correspondence as he regularly kept copies of his own letters. </p>
         <p>Inman's copious diaries provide almost daily detail of his life from 1950-1994. In his
            diaries Inman recorded daily events, poetic inspirations, and his responses to world
            events. The diaries also include information about the poetry he is working on and
            several include typescripts of completed poems.</p>
         <p>Inman also kept detailed records concerning his completed writings. He kept typescript
            copies of his poems and other writings, ordering them chronologically into notebooks,
            and recording publication information onto the typescripts. In organizing this
            collection, Inman's notebooks were discarded, but the typescripts maintain the order
            they held while bound in the notebooks, and serve to provide a chronological overview of
            Inman's published and unpublished writings.</p>
         <p>This collection also contains copies of several of the anthologies and literary
            magazines where Inman published his work and several of the poetic monographs that Inman
            authored.</p>
         <p>Inman regularly published his early work in newspapers in North Carolina. The collection
            contains clippings of these early published works as well as clippings of Inman's mid
            1960's newspaper column "Conchsounds in the Hills."</p>
         <p>There are also photographs of the McGirt family from ca. 1910, chiefly mounted in
            albums, as well as Inman's baby book from 1923. (16 accessions from 1998 and 1999)
            (35,475 items, 59 linear feet; dated 1910-1999)</p>
         <p>The addition (accession #2001-0195) (1676 items, 2.7 linear feet; dated 1940-2001, bulk
            1976-2001) comprises mainly personal correspondence to and from Inman and Jimmy Santiago
            Baca, 1971-1995, including typescript poetry. It also includes typescript poetry by
            Inman as Bill McGirt, 1940-1956; other poetry by Inman; professional correspondence; and
            a journal kept by Inman, 2000-2001. </p>
         <p>The addition (accession #2002-0143) (2250 items, 3.60 linear feet; dated 1982-2001)
            consists primarily of incoming and outgoing personal correspondence. Topics include
            Inman's poems, publication work, and his political activites. There is also poetry and
            prose by Inman and others, and 20 black-and-white and 148 color photographs.</p>
         <p>The addition (accession# 2003-0124 and 2003-0181)(2775 items, 3.6 linear feet; dated
            1957-2003, bulk 1970-1989) contains published and unpublished typescript poetry written
            by Will Inman. Also includes literary newsletters, periodicals and brochures; a notebook
            containing poetry, biographical information and professional correspondence; and a
            paperweight.</p>
         <p>Addition (2009-0263) (500 items, 0.6 lin. ft.; dated 1976-2009) includes correspondence,
            poetry by Inman and others, press releases and reviews, official documents (such as his
            birth certificate, insurance information, and medical documents), and materials from
            Inman's death and funeral.</p>

                     writings that the prisoners produced during and after Inman's workshop and
                     provide insights into the intense and supportive relationships that Inman
                     developed with the prisoners. While this portion of the collection is open for
                     research, those using it may not quote the names of individual prisoners. This
                     correspondence has been arranged chronologically to the year level, but may
                     need further processing before use.</p>
