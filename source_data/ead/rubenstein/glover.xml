         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Emma Simpson Glover, daughter of Germaine Franklin and Margaret (?) Simpson, was born
            during the late 1870s or 1880s in Midway Mills, Nelson County, Va. The papers also
            document the existence of at least two sisters, Mary and Mabel; a brother, Walter
            Charles; and an uncle, Charles H. Simpson, who later published several novellas based on
            his experiences in Montana. Emma remained in Midway Mills until she married Samuel
            Ridout Glover, a physician, in 1911, when she moved to nearby Howardsville, Va. Emma's
            mother died around 1896; her father died in 1906.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The papers consist of correspondence, legal and financial papers, photographs, account
            books, a memoir book, and miscellaneous papers and span the time period from 1834 to
            1953. The bulk of the papers consists of correspondence between 1862 and 1914. This
            correspondence falls roughly into three major periods, each one consisting of two or
            three dozen letters.</p>
         <p>The first period lasts until the 1890s and focuses on G. F. Simpson's involvement with
            the construction of a silver ore-crushing mill in Helena, Montana Territory, a venture
            shared with his brother, Charles H. Simpson; land investments in Kansas; and, after the
            1860s, iron ore mining operations in Virginia. The letters from Montana and Kansas also
            document the harsh life on the American frontier. Included with this mostly business
            correspondence are a few letters from Thomas B. Sykes describing his experiences at Camp
            Chase, a Union prisoner-of-war camp near Columbus, Ohio, and as a resident of Aberdeen,
            Miss. during Reconstruction.</p>
         <p>The second period, from the 1890s to 1910, consists chiefly of letters to Emma or her
            sisters Mary and Mabel, which discuss news of family and friends.</p>
         <p>The last period, 1910-1914, consists mostly of correspondence between Emma and her
            husband Dr. Samuel R. Glover during their courtship and early marriage. Dr. Glover's
            letters include a limited discussion of his medical practice.</p>
         <p>The legal papers include a will, mortgages, and land deeds. The financial papers include
            receipts and notes, some belonging to the firm of Simpson, Bass and Co. of Richmond,
            Va., operated by Charles H. Simpson and L. L. Bass, who were commission merchants in
            flour, grain, hay, and other provisions. The miscellaneous papers include clippings and
            printed material. There are photographs of Emma Simpson Glover, J. W. Simpson, and Mrs.
            Margaret Simpson.</p>
         <p>The bound volumes consist of two ledgers and accounts, 1914-1921, of Dr. Glover's
            medical practice; ledger and accounts, 1877-1882, of a general store in Nelson Co., Va.,
            which includes entries for farm and farm labor; and a memoir or scrap book of Mary
            Simpson, consisting of printed material, clippings, ribbons, and other memorabilia. The
            memoir book originally served as the cash book of an unknown Virginia firm for
            1834-1836.</p>
