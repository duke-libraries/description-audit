      <p>Roy Radner was Born in Chicago on June 29th 1927 and is currently the Leonard N. Stern
        Professor of Business at New York University. He studied mathematics from 1945 to 1956 at
        the University of Chicago. There, he obtained a Ph.D. in mathematical statistics entitled
        Team Decision Functions (1956) under the supervision of Leonard Savage. He was also a
        researcher at the Cowles Commission from 1951 to 1957, before moving to the University of
        California Berkeley (1957-1969), making a quick passage at Harvard (1977-1979), and then
        spending some years at AT&amp;T Bell Lab (1979-1995) that overlapped with its beginning at
        New York University (1983-). Throughout these years, he worked as a consultant for various
        private and public entities. </p>
      <p>He is probably most well-known among scholars for three contributions. The first one on the
        theory of "Team", especially with Jacob Marschak, which culminated in the 1972 publication
        of the book Economic Theory of Team. The second one is on growth theory with his 1961
        contribution to the so-called "Turnpike Theorems". The third one is on general equilibrium
        theory with time and uncertainty, where he introduced a notion of equilibrium involving
        rational expectations in the early 1970s, today (meaning 2016) known as a "Radner
        Equilibrium" in financial economics. More generally, Radner made key contributions on the
        economics of information and on bounded rationality in economics. He is married to economist
        Charlotte Kuh, and has collaborated with her on some papers.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Roy Radner Papers contain 6 series. The series "Writings" (1951-2013) includes Radner's
        published and unpublished papers, with various materials related to them (e.g.,
        correspondence with editors and colleagues, multiple drafts with hand-written notes,
        hand-written sheets of mathematical developments etc.). The series "Correspondence"
        (1954-2014) includes his correspondence sorted by individuals' names. Files include
        correspondence with and about, or only about, the individual named on a given file. There is
        also a set of personal files. Due to the large number of recommendation letters and other
        personnel-related content of the Correspondence series, this portion of the collection is
        restricted until 2050. The series "Teaching" (1967-2012) contains materials related to his
        teaching activity (e.g., syllabus, reading lists and packets, exercises with solutions). The
        bulk of it is largely from the Stern School (New York University) from the late 1990s to the
        early 2010s. The series "Research Activities" (1962-2014) includes materials about
        activities such as seminars, workshops, study groups and the like. Finally, the series
        "Writings by Others" (1954-2006) contains materials written by other researchers, with or
        (in most cases) without notes from Radner. There are no specific connections among the
        series to be noted, except the fact that, by virtue of their thematic organizations, one can
        find academic and administrative letters in all the series, i.e., not only in
        "Correspondence."</p>
      <p>Collection contains electronic records that must be requested and accessed in our reading
        room. Contact Research Services with questions.</p>

    <arrangement id="aspace_3a3a37290b8831ab61d713b5eac5f9da">
      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>The collection arrived from Roy Radner fairly well divided into six groups: "Published
        Papers" (6 boxes), "Notes on Published Papers" (2 boxes), "Notes on Research" (4 boxes),
        "Correspondence" (7 boxes), "Miscellaneous Files/Papers" (1 box) and "Teaching Notes" (5
        boxes). "Correspondence" remained practically untouched, a very small number of letters from
        the other files have been refiled here. "Teaching Notes" has been renamed "Teaching", and
        re-organized alphabetically. For the same reason, the remaining of the four series that has
        not been refiled elsewhere has been collapsed into three new series: "Writings," "Research
        Activities," and "Writings by Others". Duplicates and student grades/coursework have been
        removed from the collection. Accordingly, it should be noted that the series "Research
        Activities" partly overlaps with "Teaching" in the sense that most workshops run by Radner
        could be attended by students, and the latter could be graded on a paper about the contents
        of these workshops.</p>

          <p>This series includes Radner's published and unpublished papers from 1951 until 2013,
            with various materials related to them. Such materials can include: correspondence with
            editors and colleagues, multiple drafts with hand-written notes, hand-written sheets of
            mathematical developments, numerical sheets of simulation or experimental data, others'
            papers (not always annoted), transparencies and other oral presentation-related
            materials, and articles cut from newspapers and magazines. Most of the papers are
            academic; those that are related to his consulting activities have typically then served
            as the basis for subsequent academic publications.</p>

          <p>This series contains Roy Radner's correspondence, from 1959 up until 2014. Files are
            sorted by individuals' names. Roughly half the files include an actual correspondence
            between Radner and the individual named on the file, while the other half contains
            materials about the individual named on the file (mostly recommendation letters, but
            also papers, Ph.D. dissertations, CVs). There is also a set of personal files -- the
            names of which all start by "Radner, Roy".</p>

          <p>This series contains materials related to Roy Radner's teaching activity. Half of it
            (i.e., a full box) is about the course "Microeconomics: Theory and Application (META)",
            taught at the Stern School (NYU) from 2000 up until 2012. The other half is about
            various courses (all microeconomics courses, mostly about the theory of the firm, and
            some notably as applied to environmental issues) taught at different institutions
            (though the bulk is largely at the Stern School from the late 1990s to the early 2010s).
            The different types of materials can be: syllabus, reading lists and packets, exercises
            with solutions, administrative documents, and a few notes taken for the preparation of
            courses.</p>

          <p>This series contains writings by others, i.e., mostly published papers but also working
            papers and Ph.D. dissertations, with or (in most cases) without notes from Radner. These
            documents were dispersed in all the series of the original collection, hence the
            constructed thematic organization is not Radner's. Accordingly, it should be noted the
            distinctions between "Firms and Decentralization", "Game Theory and Principal-Agent" and
            "Teams" is made on intuitive and semantic grounds (i.e., with respect to the words used
            in the titles of the papers), not on substantial theoretic grounds. It should also be
            noted that the dates displayed in this series are publication dates of the papers, not
            necessarily the dates at which Radner made notes about them or printed them.</p>
