      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles (DMB&amp;B) Archives consists of advertising agency
        records spanning the years 1929 to 1995. The bulk of the material dates from the 1950s to
        the mid-1980s. The Archives includes material that documents aspects of three advertising
        agencies: D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles (DMB&amp;B), Benton &amp; Bowles (B&amp;B), and
        D'Arcy-MacManus &amp; Masius (D-MM).</p>
      <p>The Archives as a whole provides a comprehensive overview of Benton &amp; Bowles
        advertisements (1932-1995) and commercials (1950s-1980s), primarily those created by the
        agency's New York office. Other major topics include the advertising careers of William B.
        Benton and Atherton W. Hobler; research and publication about the history of Benton &amp;
        Bowles by Gordon Webber and Frank Smith; television programs created by B&amp;B in the
        1950s; aspects of employee training, recruitment, and management; and marketing research.
        The Archives also documents the merger of the D'Arcy-MacManus &amp; Masius agency with
        Benton &amp; Bowles to form DMB&amp;B in 1985. There is very little information in the
        Archives about the D'Arcy-MacManus &amp; Masius agency prior to the merger. Also, material
        about Benton &amp; Bowles offices other than New York is limited, and found mostly in
        B&amp;B house organs.</p>
      <p>The D'Arcy-MacManus Masius Files comprise a very small amount of materials in the Archives.
        Although the D'Arcy agency had its roots in 1906, the Items gathered here date only from
        1972-1985, mainly 1981 to 1985. They consist of corporate publications, notes, and
        clippings. The 75th Anniversary edition of <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Between
          Us</title> contains an overview of the history of D'Arcy-MacManus &amp; Masius, especially
        of the D'Arcy Advertising Company, and its clients. <title type="simple" render="italic"
          >Profiles,</title> a resource book, provides information on all of the divisions of the
        D'Arcy -MacManus Masius Worldwide group of advertising agencies.</p>
      <p>The Benton and Bowles Files are by far the largest part of the Archives. They include
        primarily print advertisements (the largest series in the Archives), but also over 500
        films, significant documents relating to the work of the agency, photographs, and corporate
        publications. The Benton &amp; Bowles Files span the years 1929 to 1985, although most of
        the material dates from 1950s and after. Item types in the collection include internal
        memoranda; reports; speeches; printed material (manuals, leaflets, pamphlets, and house
        organs); photographs; research notes; credentials; employee training material; press
        releases and clippings; book manuscripts; audio tapes of oral history interviews; and
        financial papers. The Benton &amp; Bowles Files provide documentation of the history of
        print and television advertising; television programming; the history of the B&amp;B agency
        and its corporate culture; corporate communications; marketing research; and advertising
        executives.</p>
      <p>The earliest Items in the B&amp;B Files are two small bank books recording account activity
        of the fledgling agency from 1929 to 1935 and copies of William (<emph render="doublequote"
          >Billie</emph>) Benton's long letters to his mother, 1929-1938, in which he confides
        details of his new advertising agency as well as family matters. A small number of other
        Items date from the 1930s and 1940s and illustrate isolated aspects of the agency's business
        in that period.</p>
      <p>Long series of various agency house organs begin in 1947 and provide the most complete and
        continuous views of Benton &amp; Bowles, its clients, advertising campaigns, personnel, and
        various offices in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
      <p>The Advertisements Series is the largest section of the Archives and contains comprehensive
        files of print advertising campaigns developed mainly by Benton &amp; Bowles from 1932-1980.
        The series includes primarily proofs, along with some tearsheets, of consumer and trade
        advertisements, most from U.S. magazines and newspapers. Files for a few clients include
        unusual material, such as packaging or client newsletters. Most of the advertisements were
        removed from large scrapbooks into which B&amp;B employees had pasted them; many have
        suffered glue damage, but they remain an invaluable source for studying the development of a
        number of advertising campaigns over long periods of time. Longtime clients of B&amp;B
        included Procter &amp; Gamble and General Foods, among many others. Neither the
        Advertisements Series nor any other part of the Archives contains substantial documentation
        of the creative processes behind the advertisements and advertising campaigns.</p>
      <p>For additional information about the Advertisements Series, see the data collection sheets
        in the Information Folders about the DMB&amp;B Archives. The data collection sheets provide
        notes about: languages, other than English, used in the advertisements; countries, other
        than the United States, for which advertisements were produced; the use of celebrities in
        the advertisements; themes or social and political issues that can be studied in the
        advertisements; and the use of comic illustrations. The data collection sheets also note the
        existence of collateral literature for certain advertising campaigns. The Information
        Folders also contain a list of Benton &amp; Bowles clients and the dates of agency-client
        relationships. </p>
      <p>The Audiovisual Series (RESTRICTED) contains over 500 reels of 16mm film varying in lengths
        from 200' to 1600'. The majority of the films are compilations of commercials created mainly
        by Benton &amp; Bowles for many different clients. Also included are several dozen reels of
        vintage television programs (shows created or sponsored by B&amp;B), several stockholders'
        meetings, speeches, new business presentations, and outtakes. At the time of this writing,
        most of the films have not been viewed in their entirety, indexed, or reformatted. However,
        a selection of films has been reformatted for research use.</p>
      <p>Addition (accession #2001-0103) (554 items, 7.5 linear ft.; dated [ca. 1950s]-[1980s])
        comprises 16-mm film reels of commercials. Brand names and clients include Crest, Post
        cereals, Scope, Yardley, Hardees, Grape Nuts, Hasbro, and Pampers. Viewing of commercials is
        restricted until videocassette use copies are made. For a container list, contact Research
        Services. </p>

            <p>Includes primarily printed materials, as well as photographs and negatives,
              manuscript drafts of publications, and memoranda. The publications chronicle company
              history from <unitdate era="ce" calendar="gregorian" type="inclusive"> 1947</unitdate>
              to the <unitdate era="ce" calendar="gregorian" type="inclusive"> 1980s</unitdate>Most
              of the runs for each publication are complete and they form the bulk of the section.
              Many of the stories about advertising campaigns center on human interest factors, such
              as the role of an actor in a commercial or a company event that launched the campaign.
              Organized into three sections: <emph render="bold">House Organs</emph>, <emph
                render="bold">Credentials</emph>, and Press Releases. The <emph render="bold"
                >Credentials</emph> were created by Benton &amp; Bowles to give prospective clients
              a general overview of the company and its services. House Organs focus primarily on
              news about the company, but also include a considerable amount of information about
              clients and advertising campaigns, management, domestic and international offices of
              Benton &amp; Bowles subsidiary companies, corporate research, other advertising
              agencies, and various business, social, and personal activities of Benton &amp; Bowles
              employees. The <emph render="bold">Press Releases</emph> include news about management
              changes, research reports, and clients. Credentials are arranged chronologically;
              House Organs, in alphabetical order by title, then chronologically; and Press Releases
              are in chronological order. See also oversize materials.</p>

            order by the reel number. Some individual cans contain detailed contents lists. For
