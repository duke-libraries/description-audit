         <abstract id="aspace_1635074ff4b851d635ac4baafab3b0ea">John O'Toole (1929-1995) was an
            American advertising executive who served as Chairman of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, Inc.
            (FCB) from 1981-1985. He also served as President of the American Association of
            Advertising Agencies (AAAA) from 1988-1995. The John O'Toole Papers cover the years
            1954-1990, with the bulk of materials dating from the 1980s, roughly the period when
            O'Toole served as Chairman of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding (FCB), and as an executive with
            the American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA). The collection primarily
            consists of correspondence; speeches; research reports; business presentations; and
            slides related to FCB management and advertising activities. The collection also
            includes several proofs; clippings; and a film of television advertisements for Merrill
            Lynch. Advertisers represented in the collection include British Airways; Clairol;
            Colgate-Palmolive; Frito-Lay; Gillette; Heinz; Jockey; Pepsi; Sunkist; and Volkswagen.

         <p>During his adolescent years, John O'Toole wrote several plays for a local radio station
            and over 200 poems for newspapers, magazines and anthologies. At age 18, one of his
            books of poetry was published; the proceeds from this publication paid for his first
            year of college.</p>
         <p>O'Toole worked as a waiter, radio announcer and meter reader before beginning a career
            in the advertising business. O'Toole's first advertising job was for Batten, Barton,
            Durstine &amp; Osborn, where he served as copywriter on the accounts Royal Crown Cola,
            Ac'cent, and Amity Leather Products. In 1954, he joined the staff of Foote, Cone &amp;
            Belding (FCB), where he began as Copy Writer and subsequently became Copy Supervisor,
            Vice President, Creative Director of the Los Angeles and Chicago offices. During his
            career, he wrote copy and campaign themes for more than 40 television commercials. Some
            of his major clients included the First National Bank of Chicago, Kimberly-Clark
            Corporation, General Foods, Armour Soap Works and Kraft Foods.</p>
         <p>O'Toole also served prominently in the American Association of Advertising Agencies
            (AAAA), as Director and then President of the Association. He also served as Director of
            the National Advertising Review Council, and served on the Board of Directors of John
            Nuveen Mutual Funds. </p>
