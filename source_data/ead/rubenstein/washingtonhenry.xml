      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection comprises an African-American family photograph album maintained by Henry
        Washington within a three ring binder between approximately 1940-1982. The album features
        261 prints, including 204 black-and-white and 57 color prints, ranging in size from 1x1
        inches to 8x10 inches. The photographs present the Washington family and its social networks
        in detail, with a focus on Boston's Roxbury neighborhood. Only a few images reflect the
        service members with whom Washington served during World War II or the military service of
        family members. The majority of the photographs are uncaptioned. A family member has
        identified several photographs of Henry Washington. Four additional photographs were laid
        in, including a photograph of a clipping regarding Washington's birth, along with two sets
        of laminated newspaper clippings dating from 1877. A photocopy of the original pages has
        been created, and the photograph album has been unbound to preserve the photographs.
        Acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and African American
        History and Culture.</p>
