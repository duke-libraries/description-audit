         <abstract id="aspace_f416f0eb707c5841fb78f62655b12345">Leonid Hurwicz (1917-2008) was
            Regents' Professor Emeritus of Economics at the University of Minnesota and recipient of
            the 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science for his work on mechanism design. The
            bulk of the Leonid Hurwicz papers span the years 1930-2008, covering his entire career
            as an economist, from his early work in the 1940s and 1950s at the Massachusetts
            Institute of Technology (MIT), the University of Chicago, and the Cowles Commission,
            until his death in 2008. The collection is arranged in the following series:
            Correspondence, Personal Files, Printed Materials, Professional Service, Research and
            Writings (about 70% of the collection), and Teaching Materials. Though there are
            correspondence, legal, financial, and other papers relating to Hurwicz's forced
            migration to the United States, there have been no items discovered documenting his
            training as an economist at the University of Warsaw or at the London School of
            Economics in the 1930s. The majority of the collection focuses on Hurwicz's work after
            1970, most notably his collaborations with Stanley Reiter, Kenneth Arrow, Don Saari,
            Thomas Marschak and Marcel Richter.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The bulk of the Leonid Hurwicz Papers span the years 1930-2008, covering his entire
            career as an economist in the United States, from his early work at MIT, the University
            of Chicago and the Cowles Commission until his death while Emeritus Professor at the
            University of Minnesota. The collection is arranged in the following series: <emph
               render="bold">Correspondence, Personal Files, Printed Materials, Professional Service
               Series, Research and Writings</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Teaching
               Materials</emph>. Though there are correspondence, legal, financial, and other papers
            documenting his migration to the United States, there have been no items discovered that
            document his training as an economist at the University of Warsaw or at the London
            School of Economics. The majority of the collection focuses on Hurwicz's work after
            1970, most notably his collaborations with Stanley Reiter, Kenneth Arrow, Don Saari,
            Thomas Marschak and Marcel Richter. </p>
         <p>Though there is a significant amount of personal and professional correspondence, the
            majority of the papers reside in the 142 boxes of the <emph render="bold">Research and
               Writings Series</emph>, which contains extensive files of Hurwicz's research notes,
            reprints, and revisions of working papers by Hurwicz and others with added annotations.
            The research files document important developments in postwar mathematical economics and
            Hurwicz's seminal contributions to this field of study.</p>
         <p>Recurring subjects in Research and Writings include Cowles-style econometrics; the
            stability of general equilibrium; the integrability of demand functions; the study of
            monopolies and oligopolies, as well as socialized systems; decision-making under
            ambiguity; the second welfare theorem; the applications of game theory to economic,
            social and political issues; and the development of mechanism design, for which Hurwicz
            was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2007. With his theories on mechanism design
            (including the notion of incentive-compatibility), Hurwicz analyzed the functioning of
            institutions and communication systems such as banking, auctions, and privatized
            markets, and compared political systems such as socialism and capitalism.</p>
         <p>In addition to documenting Hurwicz's work in theoretical economics, the collection also
            follows his professional activities at the University of Minnesota, both as a teacher
            and as an active member of the Economics Department, his participation on various
            committees, and his work with institutions such as the Cowles Commission, RAND
            corporation, the National Science Foundation, and the American Academy of Arts and
            Sciences. Also in evidence is Hurwicz's interest in the development of foreign
            economies, with an emphasis on East Asia, Russia, and Eastern Europe. His numerous
            travels and presentations during his career as well as his continuous relations with
            European and Asian economists are documented chiefly in the <emph render="bold"
               >Professional Service Series</emph>. Finally, the <emph render="bold">Printed
               Materials Series</emph> as well as the <emph render="bold">Research and Writings
               Series</emph> offer a significant amount of works by others documenting the
            development of recent economics. Many are heavily annotated by Hurwicz.</p>
         <p>Electronic files which were readable have been transferred to the electronic records
            server. They consist chiefly of word processing documents containing drafts of <title
               type="simple" render="italic">Informational Efficiency,</title> which Hurwicz
            co-authored with Reiter in the late 1990s. A use copy of original electronic files must
            be made before contents can be accessed; please contact Research Services before coming

               <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
               <p>Consists of two groupings of professional correspondence maintained by Hurwicz,
                  chiefly from the 1970s and 1980s; there is electronic email as well dating from
                  approximately 1998-2008. There is no significant difference between the two
                  subseries of papers, except that the first is more focused on the 1980s and the
                  second chiefly on the period from 1977-1979. The two collections overlap
                  occasionally. There are a few attached reprints or notes. The files are arranged
                  alphabetically by senders or recipients, or by subject.</p>
               <p>Though the files contain extensive correspondence between Hurwicz and his
                  colleagues, these exchanges are for the most part routine and contain few extended
                  conversations on economics. Original folder titles are retained. Additional and
                  perhaps more significant correspondence may be found in the Research Files
                  (particularly in the Arrow, Marschak, Reiter and Uzawa files), as well as in the
                  Professional Service Series. A small but significant amount of correspondence
                  regarding Hurwicz's immigration and earliest years in the United States is located
                  in the Personal Files Series - much of this in Polish.</p>

               <p>Series includes early letters, memorabilia, and other items documenting Hurwicz's
                  migration to the U.S. from Poland and his early years in the U.S. (1939-1946);
                  curriculum vitae; press clippings and articles; Nobel Prize memorabilia; and
                  obituaries following his death in 2009. Languages include French and Polish.
                  Included are documents from Hurwicz's early student years in Poland and at the
                  London School of Economics, as well as early papers from his first positions in
                  the U.S. Many of the letters written in Polish to Hurwicz in the early 1940s
                  appear to be from his father and other family members, who, with Hurwicz's
                  efforts, also emigrated to the U.S. after he had established himself in the U.S.
                  Folders and their contents have been kept mostly in original order as filed by
                  Hurwicz. Arranged alphabetically by folder title, with the correspondence in
                  chronological order.</p>

               <p>Consists chiefly of reprints and working papers, generally bound printed materials
                  with a few annotations. Hurwicz's reprints and working papers are arranged in
                  chronological order. Printed materials by colleagues are arranged by alphabetical
                  order of the first author's last name. Though these are mainly articles, they also
                  include PhD dissertations, reports or memoranda which are arranged alphabetically
                  by author's name or by the institution for which it was written. The series also
                  contains a full box of various brochures (economics departments, conference
                  programs) and a box filled with unidentified papers in Russian.</p>

                        <p>These papers document Hurwicz's works in relation with Thomas Marschak
                           (no relation to Jacob Marshak). They contain drafts and notes on
                           collaborative works as well as reprints of Marschak's works with
                           annotations by Hurwicz. Most of their collaboration took place during the
                           1980s and dealt with mechanism design (dimensional requirements, resource
                           allocations mechanisms). Arranged chronologically.</p>

                        <p>Hurwicz's collaboration with Stanley Reiter and Donald Saari represents a
                           significant part of the Research and Writings Series. Spanning over three
                           decades, those are very dense research materials including numerous
                           projects, drafts, revisions, book chapters, proofs and presentations in
                           seminars and conferences. The main output of this collaboration is
                           Hurwicz and Reiter's <title type="simple" render="italic">Designing
                              Economic Mechanisms</title>, published in 2006. Preliminary work in
                           relation with this book begins by 1978. Those papers are divided in two
                           subseries: the Reiter collaboration and the HRS collaboration. HRS seems
                           to be mostly a subdivision of the work by Hurwicz and Reiter, with added
                           commentaries by Saari. Numerous drafts of book chapters with a similar
                           aspect can be found with numerous annotations and subtle differences. One
                           may find seemingly similar materials in the H/R files (11 boxes) on one
                           hand and in the H/R/S files (12 boxes) on the other hand.</p>
                        <p>The material, dealing with mechanism design, is heavily mathematical with
                           an extensive use of geometric techniques - annotated reprints of Spivak's
                              <title type="simple" render="italic">Differential Geometry</title> are
                           included. Recurring themes are the rectangle method and the condensation
                           theorem. Beside collaborative works, these papers include other works by
                           Reiter and Saari, with light annotations by Hurwicz and/or related
                           correspondences. Each subseries is arranged in chronological order.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
               <p>Represents approximately seventy percent of the collection. Contains notes,
                  drafts, working papers, reprints, annotated manuscripts, faxes and letters related
                  to Hurwicz's work as an economist. These papers span Hurwicz's entire career from
                  his work with Kenneth Arrow and Hiro Uzawa at Cowles in the 1940s on the stability
                  of general equilibrium and the integrability of demand functions, to his
                  collaboration with Stanley Reiter on <title type="simple" render="italic"
                     >Designing Economic Mechanisms</title> (2006).</p>
               <p>For the most part, Hurwicz's original arrangement and folder titles have been
                  retained. The materials are ordered into two subseries: <emph render="bold"
                     >Topical</emph> and <emph render="bold">Other Research</emph>. Roughly half of
                  the Research and Writings series (51 boxes) is arranged in a <emph render="bold"
                     >Topical Subseries</emph>. File folders represent either an important topic
                  within Hurwicz's work or an extended collaboration with a colleague; there are
                  also geographical files, including one on China. Within folders, materials are
                  arranged in rough chronological order. There are also three boxes of
                  correspondence related to works by others and seven boxes of unbound annotated
                  works by others (in contrast with those included with the Printed Materials
                  series, these are unbound and some are unpublished).</p>
               <p>Ninety-one other boxes in the <emph render="bold">Other Research Subseries</emph>
                  contain files that have retained their original order as received by the library
                  and have been given basic processing and arrangement. The descriptions are broad,
                  with significant topics or individuals highlighted; not all folders are
                  represented. There are a number of files related to geographical headings,
                  especially relating to the economies of the former Soviet Union and Eastern
                  Europe, and in smaller degree to Poland and New Zealand. Hurwicz also was
                  interested in refugees and public policy, and this is reflected by folders of
                  material on that subject. </p>

                  <p>Chiefly consists of Hurwicz's research notes and drafts relating to projects
                     and collaborations; correspondence folders; reprints, articles, and other
                     writings by other economists, scientists, and students; conference records; and
                     other mixed papers. May also contain some personal papers and teaching
                     materials. Early dates refer chiefly to reprints and articles, often
                     accompanied by Hurwicz's notes on those early works. Topics covered by research
                     notes and other materials vary, but focus chiefly on mathematical equations and
                     modeling for institutional change, equilibrium, mechanism design, convergence,
                     and condensation. There are many folders with materials relating to Hurwicz's
                     collaborations with Stan Reiter. At least several folders of materials from the
                     1990s and early 2000s focus on Indian, Eastern European and Russian economic
                     changes.</p>

               <p>Chiefly consists of photocopies, course notes, transparencies and exam subjects.
                  While as a whole the materials cover Hurwicz's entire career, the majority
                  document his teaching activities after 1980. Documents are arranged in rough
                  chronological order, with the exception of two boxes: one is organized instead by
                  topic, and contains courses on econometrics; the other contains PhD dissertations
                  supervised by Hurwicz.</p>
