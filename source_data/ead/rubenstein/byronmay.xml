      <abstract id="aspace_7c396ab0e18fececac5fef61007c13fc">May Byron was a prolific British author
        best known for her children's books including a series of biographies and abridgements of J.
        M. Barrie's Peter Pan. In this letter, she responds to Rev. Edwin J. Matthews' request for
        the most important life lesson she's learned and for a list of her publications. Byron
        responds that she couldn't possibly sum up her life's experiences into one lesson, and that
        she can't provide a list of her publications because she's lost track of them. She does note
        that most of her children's books are still in print and have "been going on selling for
        some 20 years."</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection consists of a single autograph manuscript letter written by May Byron to
        Reverend Edwin J. Matthews. Byron's return address is "c/o British Weekly" and Matthews'
        address is "The Rectory, Calstone, Calne, Wiltshire." Matthews had written to ask Byron,
        "the one lesson which has been most impressed upon me by my life's experiences." Byron
        replies, "These experiences have been so wide, so varied, and in several respects so unique
        that I could not possibly sum up their results in one lesson." Matthews had also asked Byron
        for a list of her writings, and she replies that she's unable to do so because she's lost
        track of them. She states that both the British Museum and the Library of Congress had asked
        her for a similar list, and she was unable to help them, in part because of her use of
        pseudonyms, and also because of her many years' work as a journalist. She concludes by
        stating that most all her writings are currently out of print, except for her children's
        books, "which have been going on selling for some 20 years."</p>
