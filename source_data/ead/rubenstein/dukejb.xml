      <abstract id="aspace_574cbc8dd30ae347c46c9bcfb27fadd7">James B. Duke (1856-1925) was a tobacco
        manufacturer, industrialist, and philanthropist of Durham, North Carolina, and New York City
        and the youngest son of Washington Duke. He was also father to Doris Duke, who inherited a
        considerable portion of her father's estate at an early age and became known as "the richest
        girl in the world." James B. Duke's major business concerns included W. Duke, Sons and
        Company; American Tobacco Company; British American Tobacco Company; and Southern Power
        Company. His philanthropic activities included endowments of Trinity College (later renamed
        Duke University) and Lincoln Hospital of Durham, North Carolina. In December 1924, Duke
        established the Duke Endowment, a permanent trust fund whose beneficiaries include Duke
        University and three other institutions of higher education, rural churches, non-profit
        hospitals, and child care institutions throughout North and South Carolina. The collection
        was compiled from various sources and includes: correspondence; business, legal, and
        financial papers; estate and inheritance records; printed materials; miscellaneous
        materials; architectural drawings and blueprints; and pictures chiefly relating to the
        businesses, enterprises and philanthropy of James Buchanan Duke in North Carolina, South
        Carolina, New York, New Jersey, and Québec, Canada. About one-half of the collection
        documents the administration of his estate. Subject areas represented include: American
        Tobacco Company; British American Tobacco Company; Southern Power Company; business;
        finance; aspects of the tobacco industry, including automation, marketing and taxation;
        hydroelectric power; textile mills; charitable works; architectural planning and interior
        decoration; genealogy of branches of the Duke family; inheritance and succession; estate
        taxation; and legal procedure for wills, inheritance and business.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The papers of James Buchanan Duke have been collected from various sources over time and
        span the years 1777 to 1999, although the bulk of the material dates from the 1890s to the
        mid-1930s. The collection is divided into 7 series: Correspondence, Business Papers, Legal
        Papers, Financial Papers, Estate Papers, Miscellaneous, and Pictures. About one half of the
        collection documents the administration of the <title type="simple" render="italic">Estate
          of James B. Duke, Deceased,</title> including legal proceedings stemming from claims made
        against the estate. The remainder of the collection deals largely with businesses and
        financial investments, mainly through the Business Papers, Financial Papers, and Estate
        Papers Series. To a lesser extent, aspects of Duke's philanthropy are documented through the
        Financial Papers, Correspondence, and Legal Papers, while personal topics are concentrated
        in the Picture Series, Miscellaneous Series, and Correspondence Series. Subject areas
        represented in the collection include: the tobacco and hydroelectric power industries;
        business and finance; philanthropy; genealogy on branches of the Duke family; inheritance;
        legal procedure; architecture and interior decoration; and, to a lesser degree, family
        life.</p>
      <p>Since brother Benjamin Newton Duke participated in many of the same businesses and
        enterprises as James B. Duke, items of his business correspondence and documents related to
        his investments and domestic expenditures are also found throughout the collection.</p>

        Legal Papers, Financial Papers, Estate Papers, Miscellaneous, and Pictures.</p>

      <head>Processing Note</head>
      <p>Information about 1991-1992 processing</p>
      <p>The current arrangement of the papers of James Buchanan Duke is the result of reprocessing,
        including reorganization and consolidation, of the materials in 1991 and 1992. This was
        undertaken to improve access for research and upgrade housing for the materials. The
        materials are now fully integrated into the collection under appropriate series and
        subseries. Throughout the collection, wherever attachments to correspondence appeared to
        have been displaced, attempts were made to re-establish these links. Check books were
        disbound and the check stubs filed in folders. Duplicate materials were removed.</p>
      <p>Materials generated during the settlement of the <title type="simple" render="italic"
          >Estate of James B. Duke, Deceased,</title> and the determination of heirs under his will
        are all filed in the <unittitle>Estate Series </unittitle>in three sections,
          <unittitle>Correspondence,</unittitle><unittitle> Legal Papers, </unittitle>and
          <unittitle>Financial Papers Subseries. </unittitle>The materials that were formerly filed
        as Research Records of Charles Caldwell are now primarily filed in the <unittitle>Estate
          Series,</unittitle>especially the <unittitle>Legal Papers Subseries. </unittitle>The
        majority of Caldwell's papers are filed in folders labeled Discovery or Claims;
        Caldwell'snotes are filed in chronological order and some correspondence is interfiled with
        the notes. Where there were no dates, the materials were kept in the order in which they
        were previously filed although some reconstruction of order was possible by comparing dated
        and undated manuscripts. Caldwell's reports to the executors and census and other records
        that he collected are filed separately from his notes. The provenance of the typed lists of
        names and relationships filed in the front of the <unittitle>Estate Series, Legal Papers
          Subseries,</unittitle>Claims folders is unclear. These lists may have been created and
        added to the collection when it was previously arranged. Most of the genealogical materials
        are filed in the <unittitle>Legal Papers Subseries</unittitle>under Claims. Evidence
        previously filed under correspondence is now in the subseries under Evidence with the index
        created by the lawyers.</p>
      <p>Some of the correspondence between James B. Duke and D. B. Strouse and P. A. Krise of the
        Bonsack Machinery Company was attached to the pages of a set of three letterbooks. To comply
        with preservation needs, the letterbooks were dismantled and the correspondence removed to
        three folders and filed in the <unittitle>Business Papers Series. </unittitle>The number of
        the letterbook page from which the leaf was removed was copied to the letter and the folders
        were arranged according to the arrangement of the original letter books. There is an index
        to the correspondence from each letter book.</p>
      <p>Business, legal, and financial records pertaining specifically to the administration of
        James B. Duke's estate are filed in the Estate Series. Similar records, not pertaining to
        the settlement of the estate, are filed in the Business Papers, Legal Papers, and Financial
        Papers Series regardless of their dates.</p>
      <p>As of 2014, tthe collection was reprocessed and many of these arrangement decisions were
        altered and are no longer valid. See updated scope and content and arrangement note.</p>

          <p>Primarily personal and business letters and telegrams received and sent by James B.
            Duke or his agents, with letters sent or received by Benjamin N. Duke scattered
            throughout the correspondence. Letters related to philanthropic ventures, including
            contributions to Trinity College (later Duke University) and requests for donations and
            other forms of aid, are also present. Since the series includes several bound
            letterbooks, the correspondence was not divided between personal and business subjects.
            Richard B. Arrington, a secretary and agent for Benjamin N. Duke and James B. Duke, is
            the principal correspondent on behalf of James B. Duke in the letterbook dated from
            August 1, 1900 to January 30, 1906. Alexander H. Sands, another secretary and agent for
            Benjamin N. Duke and James B. Duke, is the principal correspondent on behalf of James B.
            Duke in the letterbook dated from February 20, 1920 to January 17, 1923. Major
            correspondents include Lida Duke Angier (Mrs. J.C. Angier), Richard B. Arrington, W.T.
            Blackwell, Bettie Roney Dailey (Mrs. John C. Dailey), Benjamin Newton Duke, Washington
            Duke, George W. Hill, Maude Duke Karnes, William R. Perkins, and Alexander H. Sands.</p>
          <p> Loose correspondence dated after 1923 is primarily concerned with Benjamin N. Duke' s
            effort to identify and, in some cases, financially assist first and second cousins on
            the Roney side of the family. The main correspondents in this matter are Benjamin N.
            Duke, Bettie Roney Dailey, Alexander H. Sands, and Edna L. Vaughan.</p>

            bequests to various trusts, including the Duke Endowment and the Doris Duke Trust;
            accounts of James B. Duke's wealth and property at the time of his death; the income
            earned and taxes levied against ongoing investments and business concerns; and the costs
