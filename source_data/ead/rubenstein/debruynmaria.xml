          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>This series consists of printed materials and artifacts collected by de Bruyn and
            sorted into various subjects relating to public health, including reproductive rights,
            sexual health, HIV/AIDS, human rights, sexual education, and other topics. De Bruyn's
            files include a wide range of materials, broad in both content and format. She collected
            resources, publications, and books about different health issues, including published
            accounts by HIV/AIDS patients and research materials about healthcare in various
            countries. She also collected an assortment of advertisements and examples of
            contraception, male condoms, female condoms, lubricant, and buttons from various events
            and organizations addressing reproductive and sexual health, women's empowerment and
            rights, abortion, HIV-positive women and children, homosexuality, violence, and health
            education for all ages.</p>
          <p>The bulk of the arrangement was according to de Bruyn's designations, including her
            sorting within various topics by geographic subdivisions. De Bruyn's geographic
            divisions include Africa, Asia, Industrialized Countries, International, and Latin
            America/Caribbean. "Industrialized Countries" encompasses the United States, Australia,
            and Western Europe. "International" refer to publications or ephemera intended for
            international audiences, as well as ephemera created by international organizations or
            governing bodies.</p>
          <p>There is a small amount of digital media, largely DVDs and CDs, collected by de Bruyn
            and included in her subject files. There are also oversize posters, which have been
            sorted by subject but not geographically.</p>
