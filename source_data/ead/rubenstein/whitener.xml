      <head>Note on Processing and Arrangement</head>
      <p>The arrangement of the Whitener Papers has followed the system originally used by the
        Congressman's office as much as possible. The series were grouped by placing the more
        significant and larger series in the beginning. The Personal Series was placed at the end.
        Although the collection was usually left in the structure it had when it came to the
        library, many of the folders within the series were in various states of disorder.
        Rearrangement of the order of these folders was often necessary in order to create a logical
        organization, whether it be chronological, subject, or some other arrangement. Folder titles
        remain intact whenever possible, except when clarification was necessary.</p>
      <p>Although categories do indicate the contents, headings are not always inclusive. For
        example, there may be information on a Social Security bill in the Correspondence
        (Legislative) Series. However, information on the same bill may be located in other series,
        such as the House of Representatives or Judiciary. Such folders were retained in their
        original files.</p>
      <p>Weeding out of certain material was a necessary part of the cataloging process for the
        collection. Two series were discarded. They were: the File Cards Series, containing only
        names and addresses with no other notations; and the Appalachian State Graduates Series,
        including names and addresses of graduates in the Tenth Congressional District. Routine
        Items were eliminated from the collection, especially in the Correspondence (General)
        Series, Subject Series, Case Files Series, and Personal Series. Examples of such Items are
        individual Social Security claims, visa applications, routine correspondence, and duplicates
        In the Military and Veterans Series only the files for the letter "C" were retained, as well
        as a few small subject folders. The majority of the folders in the Military Academy Series
        was discarded because they were individual application materials and academic records of
        Whitener's appointees. The same procedures as above were followed for the routine Military
        and Veterans, and Military Academy files contained in the Office Files Series. For more
        specific information, see the individual descriptions of series in the inventory.</p>
      <p>Subject and autograph cards have been prepared for the card catalog, but they are very
        selective. Subject entries were made for series level topics, and for those of folder
        headings, if of sufficient importance. Whenever a subject entry was made, other references
        in other categories are possible because it was not feasible to specifically cite all
        references to a topic. Autograph cards were made only for outstanding correspondents,
        especially those in the Correspondence (General) Series.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p> Basil Lee Whitener Papers primarily contain the office files of Congressman Whitener when
        he was the U. S. Representative for the Eleventh District (85th - 87th Congresses) and Tenth
        District (88th -90th Congresses) of North Carolina. Although the papers span the years
        1889-1968, the bulk of the papers covers Whitener's years in office, 1957-1968. Some of the
        early files from the 81st through the 84th Congresses, are the papers of Woodrow Wilson
        Jones, Whitener's predecessor in office.</p>
      <p>luded in the papers are such Items as correspondence, printed material, invitations,
        speeches, clippings, financial papers, photographs, as well as legislative materials and
        drafts of bills. Much of this collection consists of correspondence between Whitener and his
        constituents, other Congressmen, and government officials.</p>
      <p>The papers are divided into the following series:</p>
      <p><list type="simple">

          <item>Correspondence (General) </item>

          <item>Personal</item>
        </list>
      </p>
      <p>By far the largest category is the Correspondence (General), even though it was weeded
        extensively. The Correspondence (Legislative) Series is also rather large. Both of these
        series contain extensive correspondence with constituents. Other large series are the
        Personal Series, which pertains more directly to Whitener's private and unofficial affairs,
        and the Office Files Series, containing files which seem to have been in active use by
        Whitener's office staff at the time he left office.</p>
      <p>There are information and opinions in the collection on a variety of issues of national
        importance during the 1960s. Included are the Vietnam War, civil rights legislation, riots,
        crime legislation, gun control, foreign aid, Social Security, and the Taft-Hartley Act.
        Other subjects are the U. S. Congress and various bills and laws. There are a variety of
        letters from prominent persons, such as John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Sargent Shriver,
        Strom Thurmond, and Sam Ervin.</p>
      <p>The views of Whitener on many national and state issues are revealed within the collection.
        He supported legislation to combat crime and civil disobedience, a strong national defense,
        and exerting every effort to bring the Vietnamese Conflict to a successful conclusion. The
        Congressman was opposed to civil rights legislation, deficit spending, foreign aid spending,
        and the proliferation of domestic and social programs. Concerning North Carolina issues,
        Whitener wanted restrictions on textile imports in order to protect jobs, and supported the
        concept of a balanced economy in the state. As a member of the Committee on the District of
        Columbia, he authored bills to curb the crime rate in the District of Columbia and a bill to
        establish a modern rail rapid transit system in the District. In general, Whitener seemed to
        exhibit the views of conservative Southern Democrats.</p>

          <p>This series, the largest in the collection, runs from the 85th Congress, first session,
              <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1957,</date> through the 90th Congress, second
            session, <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1968.</date> Included is correspondence to
            and from Whitener's constituents. Some of the letters were written by his administrative
            assistant, Herbert M. Lineberger. The papers are organized by Congress and session, and
            then alphabetically within each session by name of correspondent. In some cases
            Whitener's office held material together about a certain person in the folder for the
            letter of the alphabet for his name, regardless of the correspondents involved. For
            example, there may be letters about Mr. Capps in the <emph render="doublequote">C</emph>
            folder, which were written by various persons. There are a few subject folders included
            in the alphabetical arrangement. Items within the folders are filed chronologically.</p>
          <p>In addition to constituent mail, Whitener corresponded with prominent persons.
            Representative people are Sam Ervin, Thad Eure, Orville Freeman, Luther Hodges, J. Edgar
            Hoover, Hubert Humphrey, Lyndon Johnson, B. Everett Jordan, John F. Kennedy, Robert
            Kennedy, Dan K. Moore, Admiral Hyman Rickover, Terry Sanford, Sargent Shriver, and Strom
            Thurmond. Several letters appear in this series for each of the above correspondents.
            Please consult the Autograph File of the card catalog for a detailed listing of these
            letters.</p>
          <p>A variety of topics appear throughout the series. Particularly in the late <date
              calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1960s</date> the themes of the Vietnam War, civil
            rights legislation, riots, crime legislation, gun control, and foreign aid appear often
            in constituent's letters. In <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1968</date> some
            constituents were urging Whitener to run for governor of North Carolina. The papers go
            primarily through <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">October, 1968.</date>
          </p>
          <p>Extensive, although conservative, weeding was done in this series. The decision to weed
            was made because of the large proportion of routine material included. Approximately
            one-third of this series was discarded. The following is a list of the types of Items

            <p>Included are bills, primarily introduced by Whitener, which concern such issues in
              the District of Columbia as police, courts, crime, traffic, schools, etc. Sometimes
              only a draft or copy of the bill is enclosed, but other folders additionally contain
              reports and supplemental information. The papers, which are arranged by Congress and
              session, and by specific bill (H.R.) number, run from the 88th Congress, First
              Session, <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1963,</date> to the 90th Congress,
              Second Session, <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1968.</date> A comprehensive
              listing of the title and number of each bill in this category is filed in folder one
              of the first box of the Legislative Bills Files. Some subject entries have been made
              for important content, such as crime, but not for most bill names.</p>

          <p>This series concerns legislation and other material loosely related to the work of the
            House Committee on the Judiciary. Whitener was a member of the Judiciary Committee from
              <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1959</date> to <date calendar="gregorian"
              era="ce"> 1968.</date> See the page earlier in this inventory which describes his
            committee assignments for further information concerning his specific subcommittee
            assignments. The Judiciary Series and Judiciary Committee Series have been kept separate
            because they were organized this way in Whitener's office. The Judiciary Committee
            Series contains folders for the work of this committee and certain sub-committees. The
            Judiciary Series is larger and more general in nature. The two major files in this
            series are Legislative Bills, the largest section, and Subject Files for Legislation,
            etc.</p>

            <p>In this section, which forms a major part of the Judiciary Series, are numerous
              folders for various House of Representatives bills, as well as for a few House Joint
              Resolutions, House Concurrent Resolutions, and Senate Bills. Whitener introduced about
              two-thirds of the bills represented in this section. The folders usually contain a
              copy of the bill, and often printed reports, correspondence, and other background
              information. There was no apparent order to the bills. Therefore, they were arranged
              by Congress and session, and by specific bill (H.R.) number, and run from the 85th
              Congress, 1st Session, <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1957</date> to the 89th
              Congress, 2nd session, <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1966.</date> A
              comprehensive listing of the title and number of each bill in this category is filed
              in folder one of the first box of the Legislative Bills files. Some subject entries
              have been made for important content, such as civil rights, but not for most bill
              names.</p>

          <p>In this series are papers which primarily concern Whitener's duties as a member of the
            House Committee on the Judiciary. He was a member of this committee from <date
              calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1959</date> to <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">
              1968.</date> See the page in this inventory which describes his committee assignments
            for further information concerning his specific subcommittee assignments. Some files
            relating specifically to the work of the Judiciary Committee, and the subcommittee on
            which he served, are contained in this series. The Judiciary Committee Series and
            Judiciary Series have been kept separate because they were organized this way in
            Whitener's office. The Judiciary Series is larger and more general in nature than this
            series. The two major files in this series are Legislative Bills and Subject Files for
            Legislation, Etc.</p>

            <p>Folders for several House of Representatives bills as well as House Joint Resolution
              714, to allow Bible reading and prayer in the public schools, are included in this
              section. Whitener sponsored many of these bills. The folders usually contain a copy of
              the bill, and often printed reports, correspondence, and other background information.
              There was no apparent order to the bills, which fall in the 88th Congress, 1st
              Session, <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1963</date> ; 89th Congress, 1st
              Session, <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1965</date> ; and 90th Congress, 1st
              Session, <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1967.</date> Therefore the bills were
              arranged by Congress and session and by specific bill (H.R.) number. A comprehensive
              listing of the title and number of each bill in this category is filed in folder one
              of the first box of the Legislative Bills files. Some Subject entries have been made
              for important content but not for most bill names.</p>

          <p>Although this series is very similar to the Subject Series in that it contains folders
            on miscellaneous topics, the two series were evidently separate in Whitener's office.
            There was no consistent order to the folders, so they have been arranged alphabetically,
            similarly to the Subject Series. Some folder title revisions were necessary. A
            particularly large section of this series is the three boxes of material from the
            National Federation of Independent Business containing ballots by businessmen on various
            issues. Some routine Items such as individual Veterans Administration and social
            security claims, as well as passport applications were discarded.</p>

          <p>This series reflects the serious concern of Whitener and his constituents relating to
            textile imports and related issues such as foreign imports, cotton, the health of the
            textile industry, and tariffs. There is some material pertaining to legislation,
            especially for H.R. 6196, a bill designed to boost the cotton industry. There is some
            overlapping of similar topics among the various folders. The two major files in this
            series are Legislative Bills and Subject Files.</p>

            Most of these bills were introduced by Whitener. There was little apparent order to the

            <p>In this section are folders for various House of Representatives Bills, as well as
              for a few resolutions, and a Senate bill. This bill (S. 2658) related to vehicle
              weight and width limitations on the Interstate system. There are several folders
              pertaining to this bill, which are primarily constituent letters from <date
                calendar="gregorian" era="ce">May to July, 1968.</date> Folders usually contain a
              copy of the bill, and often printed reports, correspondence, and other background
              information. Arrangement of the folders is by Congress and session, and by specific
              bill (H.R.) number; they run from the 89th Congress, 1st Session, <date
                calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1965</date> to the 90th Congress, 2nd Session, <date
                calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1968.</date> A comprehensive listing of the title and
              number off each bill in this category is filed in folder one of the first box of the
              Legislative Bills files.</p>

              <p>The Majority of the material in the Gun Control Legislation section consists of
                letters from Whitener's constituents and from other persons interested in this
                legislation. Most of the North Carolina correspondence seems to be in opposition to
                such gun control bills as S.3604, S. 3605, and H.R. 17735, although the responses
                from non-North Carolina residents contained more mixed attitudes. Additionally there
                are letters from some government officials as well as printed material.</p>

          <p>There are two major categories included in this series: the Military and Veterans
            Files, and Subject Files. The Military and Veterans Files span the 81st Congress, 2nd
            Session, <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1950,</date> through the 90th Congress,
            2nd Session, <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1968.</date> Please note that in the
            Congressional office the military files and veterans files were kept separate through
            the 86th Congress, but that beginning with the 87th Congress, these files were combined.
            This arrangement has been retained. Also note that the early files, the 81st through the
            84th Congresses, are the papers of Woodrow Wilson Jones, Whitener's predecessor in
            office. Congressman Jones was elected to the 81st Congress to fill a vacancy and was
            reelected to the 82nd, 83rd and 84th Congresses, thus serving from <date
              calendar="gregorian" era="ce">Nov. 7, 1950,</date> to Jan. 3, <date
              calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1957.</date>
          </p>
          <p> The Military and Veterans Files primarily consist of correspondence between Jones or
            Whitener and their constituents. Generally, all correspondence for persons whose last
            name begins with the same letter of the alphabet has been kept together under that
            letter. Occasional folders appear for single individuals. These files originally formed
            a large part of the office files of Jones and Whitener. The military records, for
            persons still on active duty or in the reserves, pertain to such matters as requests for
            transfers, reassignments, allotments, hardship discharges, deferments, and dependents to
            go overseas. Constituents also wrote concerning courts-martial, Officer Candidate School
            applications, AWOL soldiers, and efforts to locate a soldier. The veterans records
            include letters concerning dependency allowances, widow pension benefits,
            hospitalization benefits, insurance, disability claims, and appeals to the Board of
            Veterans Appeals. Since these papers are very routine, concerning individual benefits
            and requests, rather than being topical in nature, only a representative sample has been
            retained. The letter <emph render="doublequote">C,</emph> a large letter which includes
            a wide range of ethnic groups, was chosen for retention, as well as a few small subject
            folders.</p>

            <p>Whitener took an inspection trip to South-Vietnam and Southeast Asia, <date
                calendar="gregorian" era="ce">July, 1966.</date> Stops were scheduled in Hawaii, the
              Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Taiwan. Included is much background material for the
              trip, such as fact sheets concerning Vietnamese commercial imports, economic
              assistance, and people. The Agency for International Development produced other
              briefing material on such topics as education, public safety, refugees, and
              agriculture. In addition, there is mimeographed information from the Library of
              Congress Legislative Reference Service on the Vietnamese War, the Soviet Union, and
              the Korean Conflict. Included are itineraries, maps, instructions, sightseeing
              information, and pamphlets concerning locations Whitener visited. There are some
              personal notes that he made while on the trip, as well as a copy of remarks he made in
              the House of Representatives on <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">July 13,
                1966,</date> upon his return.</p>

          <p>The contents concern matters relating to local post offices in Whitener's district,
            such as the location, construction, and dedication of new post office buildings; renting
            of post office quarters; improving and enlarging postal facilities; and the closing of
            postal stations. Other issues discussed include personnel matters, such as filling job
            vacancies and requests for transfers; changes and extensions of routes; a postal pay
            increase bill; the Civil Service retirement law; and requests for investigations of
            problems at post offices. The majority of the material, which consists of
            correspondence, printed material, and forms, is arranged by county and then subdivided
            by towns. The files before Whitener took office in <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"
              >January, 1957,</date> are those of Woodrow Wilson Jones, Whitener's predecessor in
            office.</p>

          <p>In this series are invitations for such functions as conventions, meetings, festivals
            and celebrations, graduations, receptions,-dedications and openings, <emph
              render="doublequote">special day</emph> events, Democratic rallies, anniversary
            events, dinners, and dances. There also are some invitations for speaking engagements.
            With an invitation is often a reply or a note as to whether Whitener will accept or
            decline the invitation. The series illustrates many of the activities of a Congressman's
            life. The papers are organized in a strictly chronological arrangement.</p>

          <p>This series contains information on a variety of topics. The subjects have been
            organized in alphabetical order with a small folder of miscellany at the end. A group of
            advertisements for office equipment was transferred to the Advertising Collection in the
            Rubenstein Library. The series contains two major files: Legislative Bills and Subject
            Files.</p>

            <p>In the Legislative Bills section there are folders for various House of
              Representatives Bills, as well as for a Senate bill. Whitener introduced about one
              half of the House bills represented here. Folders usually contain a copy of the bill,
              and sometimes printed reports, correspondence, and other background information.
              Arrangement of the folders is by Congress and session, and by specific bill (H.R.)
              number. A comprehensive listing of the title and number of each bill in this category
              is filed in folder one of the first box of the Legislative Bills files.</p>

              concerning such matters as requests for transfers and reassignments, allotments,
              hardship discharges, efforts to locate a soldier, hospitalization benefits, disability
              claims, and appeals to the Board of Veterans Appeals. Usually, all correspondence for
              persons whose last name begins with the same letter of the alphabet has been kept
              together under that letter. Since these papers are very routine, concerning individual
              benefits and requests, rather than being topical in nature, only a representative
              sample has been retained. The letter <emph render="doublequote">C,</emph> a large
              letter which includes a wide range of ethnic groups, was chosen for retention.</p>

          <p>Included are papers relating more directly to Whitener's private and unofficial
            affairs. The matters contained here range from such things as Whitener's admission to
            the District of Columbia Bar and his weekly radio program, to Whitener's apartment
            rental, bills and receipts, and family reunions.</p>
          <p>These files were in disarray, and therefore have been organized into three major
            categories: Congresses, Subject Files, and General Files. In the first subdivision,
            Congresses, the papers are grouped by Congress, session, and then alphabetically within
            each session of Congress. This information was evidently kept together in this manner by
            Whitener's office. There is repetition in some categories in various Congresses, such as
            Correspondence (Alphabetical). The explanatory notes for such categories have been
            included in the inventory only with the earliest Congress in which the category appears.
            The category, Congresses, forms the bulk of the Personal Series.</p>
          <p>In the Subject Files are topics such as the National Federation of Independent
            Business, which span several years. The General Files contain biographical information,
            financial papers, miscellany, clippings, printed material, and pictures.</p>
          <p>The following types of items were discarded from the Personal Series:</p>
          <p><list type="simple">
              <item>1. Routine bills, receipts, and statements pertaining to the ordering of office
                supplies from the U.S. House of Representatives Stationery Room.</item>
              <item>2. Many bills, receipts, and other personal financial papers.</item>
              <item>3. Routine items from the voluminous "General" files. The remaining items were
                filed among various appropriate categories, such as correspondence, printed
                material, and finanical papers.</item>
              <item>4. Certain medical records.</item>
