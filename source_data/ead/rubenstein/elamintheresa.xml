      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Theresa El-Amin started her career as a civil rights activist when she joined the Student
        Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 1965 as a student at Tuskegee University. On her
        return to Atlanta in summer of 1966, she took a job at the phone company and became active
        in the Communications Workers of America (CWA). During the 1980s and through the 1990s, she
        became involved with the Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW), the Service Employees
        International Union (SEIU), and Black Workers for Justice (BWFJ). She continued her labor
        organizing with Jobs from Justice from 1993-2006 and by serving on the Labor Notes Policy
        Committee from 2000-2009. She was a founding member of the Labor Party in 1996. Her work
        with anti-racist organizations has included the Black Radical Congress (1998-2008), the
        Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People (1999-2010), the Durham NAACP (2000-2010),
        and Solidarity, a socialist, feminist and anti-racist organization (1996-present). In 1998,
        she helped to found the Southern Anti-Racism Network (SARN), which has worked on local
        issues like the education gap and passing an anti-sweatshop ordinance in the City of Durham.
        In December 2010, El-Amin relocated to Georgia to take the role of regional organizer to
        direct SARN activities in Georgia and Alabama.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Theresa El-Amin Papers have been divided into series: Organizations and Movements,
        Subject Files, Conferences, Personal Files and Correspondence, Printed Materials,
        Photographs and Audiovisual, Black Liberation Historical Documents, Realia, and Oversize
        Materials. The largest series, <emph render="bold">Organizations and Movements</emph>,
        features materials from El-Amin's long career as an activist and union organizer with groups
        such as Black Workers for Justice, the Service Employees International Union, Jobs with
        Justice, the Green Party of the United States, the NAACP, the Coalition of Labor Union
        Women, the Black Radical Congress, Solidarity, and the Southern Anti-Racism Network. Other
        highlights of the Organizations and Movements series include the Black Liberation movement
        and the Free Mumia Abu-Jamal movement. There are also numerous other groups and movements
        represented within this series. Contents typically include handouts and fliers from various
        events; email correspondence; reports and publications from different groups, including some
        newsletters; and clippings with coverage of different campaigns and activities.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Subject Files</emph> series was largely created by El-Amin, with
        additional subjects added in processing to account for loose pages in the collection. Topics
        heavily represented include Muhammad Ahmad, community organizing and its many components,
        healthcare, South Africa and apartheid, North Carolina, and workplace safety. There are also
        subject files for several countries, as well as materials about Hurricane Katrina.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Printed Materials</emph> series includes newsletters, magazines,
        journals, fliers, handouts, and other miscellaneous materials from a wide variety of
        sources. The first box contains runs of various periodicals, including Forward Motion, In
        Defense of Marxism, and Labor Notes. These runs are incomplete and represent only a sampling
        of the publication. The second box of printed materials relates largely to El-Amin's union
        involvement, and features miscellaneous union publications from the 1980s-2000s. There is a
        small amount of earlier material, mainly in the Historical Pamphlets folder, which includes
        publications on desegregation and its impact on unions. The remainder of the series is also
        largely miscellaneous, with one or two issues of a wide range of newsletters, magazines, or
        organizational reports. </p>
      <p>The small <emph render="bold">Conferences</emph> series contains conference books, fliers,
        correspondence, and handouts from various conferences El-Amin attended between 1985 and
        2010. There is some overlap between this series and the Organizations and Movements series.
        Another small series is El-Amin's <emph render="bold">Personal Files and
          Correspondence</emph>, which consists largely of certificates and other remnants of her
        professional organizing education and career. This series also includes copies of her
        resumes and a 1997 oral history transcript.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Photographs and Audiovisual Materials</emph> series includes large
        amounts of loose photographs, labeled by El-Amin, documenting many of the organizations,
        activities, and events referenced in earlier portions of the collection. It also includes
        some personal photographs of El-Amin's family and friends. The VHS tapes in this series
        document a range of protests and issues important to the BWFJ and El-Amin's union
        organizing.</p>
      <p>Articles and pamphlets acquired by El-Amin relating to the Black Panther Party and the
        Black Liberation movement of the 1960s are included in the <emph render="bold">Black
          Liberation Historical Documents</emph> series. Highlights include a transcript of Stokely
        Carmichael, Chairman of SNCC, speaking at the 1966 Berkeley conference on "Black Power and
        its Challenges." Includes articles on the condition of African Americans by Bayard Rustin,
        as well as coverage of the Watts riot and recovery of the Watts area. Also includes several
        issues of <title type="simple" render="italic">Commentary Reports</title> from the
        1960s.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Realia</emph> series is largely unsorted, but includes three boxes
        of t-shirts and one box of buttons and other ephemera collected by El-Amin in her years as
        an activist.</p>
      <p>Finally, the <emph render="bold">Oversize Materials</emph> contains objects withdrawn from
        their respective series due to their large size. These include Jobs with Justice foam boards
        and posters.</p>

          <p>The <emph render="bold">Subject Files</emph> series was largely created by El-Amin,
            with additional subjects added in processing to account for loose pages in the
            collection. Topics heavily represented include Muhammad Ahmad, community organizing and
            its many components, healthcare, South Africa and apartheid, North Carolina, and
            workplace safety. There are also subject files for several countries, as well as
            materials about Hurricane Katrina. </p>
          <p>While there is some overlap between the <emph render="bold">Subject Files</emph> and
            the <emph render="bold">Organizations and Movements</emph> series, the Subject Files are
            generally more generic information about a movement or topic, whereas the Organizations
            series highlights El-Amin's involvement in a particular group or protest. Subjects have
            been arranged alphabetically.</p>

          <p>The <emph render="bold">Printed Materials</emph> series includes newsletters,
            magazines, journals, fliers, handouts, and other miscellaneous materials from a wide
            variety of sources. The first box contains runs of various periodicals, including <title
              type="simple" render="italic">Forward Motion</title>, <title type="simple"
              render="italic">In Defense of Marxism</title>, and <title type="simple"
              render="italic">Labor Notes</title>. These runs are incomplete and represent only a
            sampling of the publication. The second box of printed materials relates largely to
            El-Amin's union involvement, and features miscellaneous union publications from the
            1980s-2000s. There is a small amount of earlier material, mainly in the Historical
            Pamphlets folder, which includes publications on desegregation and its impact on unions.
            The remainder of the series is also largely miscellaneous, with one or two issues of a
            wide range of newsletters, magazines, or organizational reports. Where possible, these
            publications and printed materials have been sorted by subject. </p>
          <p>Additional publications are included in the <emph render="bold">Organizations and
              Movements</emph> series, where they have been filed with the organization that created
            them. These include Solidarity <title type="simple" render="italic">Bulletins</title>,
            Black Workers for Justice <title type="simple" render="italic">Justice Speak</title>s,
            Coalition of Labor Women newsletters, and a wide range of union publications from the
            Service Employees International Union. </p>

          <p>Photographs and videotapes from El-Amin's activities, dating from the 1970s through the
            2000s. Most of the series consists of loose photographs, which El-Amin has sorted by
            event; there are also 4 albums with similar contents. There are photographs of several
            events represented in the Organizations and Movements series, including the Black
            Radical Congress Southern Regional Conference; SPICE graduations; union rallies and
            protests; political and anti-war demonstrations; meetings of groups such as Jobs with
            Justice, SARN, NAACP, and Black Workers for Justice; and other activist events. These
            have been housed by event in separate photo packets, with any accompanying information
            recorded on the outside of each packet. El-Amin's family photographs are much less
            organized, with few captions or dates included. Includes photographs of her three
            weddings. </p>
          <p>The 7 VHS tapes are largely promotional or informational media produced for BWFJ or for
            unions.</p>
