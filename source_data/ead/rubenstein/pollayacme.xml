      <abstract id="aspace_02fabf1474f6bd9bcff5f2b9dc116532">The Acme Advertising Collection is one
        of the collections created by Professor Richard Pollay in the History of Advertising
        Archives (Faculty of Commerce, Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia).
        The collection was motivated by the observation that Acme named enterprises are
        characteristically small ventures that represent the grass roots of local and regional
        economies. At the same time, the ubiquity of the Acme brand name has made its way into
        popular culture, where it has become an icon for independent business in general, featured
        in print cartoons from artists such as Gary Larson (The Far Side) and G.B. Trudeau
        (Doonesbury), and in the Warner Bros. animated Road Runner features. Items in the Acme
        Collection come from a variety of sources. Many items were donated to Dr. Pollay, but the
        majority were acquired by Dr. Pollay himself over several decades. In earlier years items
        were found in shops, flea markets, and antique stores across North America. However, in
        recent years most items were acquired through the internet auction site, eBay
        (www.eBay.com). The Acme Advertising Collection dates from the 1850s through 2006 and
        consists of approximately 3000 items from over 900 distinct companies and producers,
        primarily of U.S. or Canadian origin, all bearing the brand name Acme. The collection
        contains a diverse array of items, both three-dimensional and printed materials, including:
        promotional items and memorabilia; trade cards; business cards; magazine tear sheets;
        catalogs; newspaper clippings; signs; displays; writing instruments; rulers; clothing; toys
        and games; school and office stationery supplies; photographs and slides. A number of
        corporations are represented in the collection, including: Acme Bail Bonds; Acme Boots; Acme
        Brick Company; Acme Harvester; Acme Markets; Acme Motor Truck Company; Acme White Lead and
        Color Works; Duane H. Nash, Inc.; Lautz Bros. and Company; and Warner Bros.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Acme Advertising Collection dates from the 1850s through 2006 and consists of
        approximately 3000 items from over 900 distinct companies and producers, primarily of U.S.
        or Canadian origin, all bearing the brand name Acme. The collection contains a diverse array
        of items, both three-dimensional and printed materials, including: promotional items and
        memorabilia; trade cards; business cards; magazine tear sheets; catalogs; newspaper
        clippings; signs; displays; writing instruments; rulers; clothing; toys and games; school
        and office stationery supplies; photographs and slides. A number of corporations are
        represented in the collection, including: Acme Bail Bonds; Acme Boots; Acme Brick Company;
        Acme Harvester; Acme Markets; Acme Motor Truck Company; Acme White Lead and Color Works;
        Duane H. Nash, Inc.; Lautz Bros. and Company; and Warner Brothers.</p>
      <p>A significant part of the collection is organized and grouped to represent rooms in a
        house. For example, kitchen items have been collected together. Office, wardrobe, and
        bathroom items are similarly gathered. Most items are represented in the Detailed
        Description by thumbnail images. In all, the collection consists of 28 Series: <emph
          render="bold">Kitchen Collectibles</emph>; <emph render="bold">Wardrobe and Bedroom
          Collectibles</emph>; <emph render="bold">Toys, Games, Sports and Recreation</emph>; <emph
          render="bold">Office and School Supplies</emph>; <emph render="bold">Domestic
          Hardware</emph>; <emph render="bold">Grocery and Store Collectibles</emph>; <emph
          render="bold">ACME Beer</emph>; <emph render="bold">Warner Brothers</emph>; <emph
          render="bold">Clothing Collectibles</emph>; <emph render="bold">Industrial
        Hardware</emph>; <emph render="bold">Bottles and Jars</emph>; <emph render="bold"
          >Catalogs</emph>; <emph render="bold">Stationery and Certificates</emph>; <emph
          render="bold">Books and Monographs</emph>; <emph render="bold">Specialty
          Advertisements</emph>; <emph render="bold">Posters, Magazine, and Newspaper
          Advertisements</emph>; <emph render="bold">Sales Oddities</emph>; <emph render="bold"
          >Photographs</emph>; <emph render="bold">eBay Files</emph>; <emph render="bold">Acme Bail
          Bonds; Acme Truck</emph>; <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials</emph>; <emph
          render="bold">Match Covers</emph>; <emph render="bold">Telephone Directories</emph>; <emph
          render="bold">Business Cards</emph>; <emph render="bold">Trade Cards</emph>; <emph
          render="bold">Slides</emph>; and <emph render="bold">Miscellaneous Items</emph>. </p>
      <p>The collection arrived already organized into 28 series. Every item had been assigned an
          <emph render="doublequote">accession number,</emph> a unique 8-digit identifier, in the
        format <emph render="doublequote">100-xx-xxx</emph>: the middle digits refer to the Series
        number, and the last three digits represent a running accession sequence within the Series.
        Items have been arranged by Series and numerically therein; however, there are a few
        exceptions where items have been transferred to another series after having been previously
        assigned an accession number. The collection also arrived with a descriptive database that
        was created and maintained by Professor Pollay's staff. The item descriptions in this
        finding aid represent a distillation of that database into a form more consistent with
        EAD-compliant finding aids. The collection has been processed with the original order
        maintained as much as possible. In addition, some items have been deaccessioned or retained
        by the donor, and only a digital image of the item exists in the collection. Those have been
        noted in the inventory.</p>
