      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The papers of Louisa E. Rhine span the years 1890 to 1983 and include journals,
        correspondence, writings, genealogical papers, notebooks, pictures, and miscellaneous papers
        relating principally to her work and research with her husband J.B. Rhine in the field of
        parapsychology, including the impact of this work on their personal and professional
        lives.</p>
      <p>This impact is shown in Louisa Rhine's journals (1903-1982). The journal entries while not
        routinely made are nevertheless often lengthy, descriptive, and self-revealing. They
        document her school days at the University of Chicago, and her courtship, marriage, and
        relationship with J.B. Rhine. Parts of four journals describe their struggle to understand
        and to formulate a personal religious philosophy. Others describe their family life and
        incidents relating to the rearing of their four children. Their work in the Parapsychology
        Laboratory at Duke, as well as the Laboratory's relationship with the Duke administration
        are described. The journals include passages from some of J.B. Rhine's letters, interspersed
        with notes relating to some of Louisa Rhine's studies. Another journal includes excerpts
        from the other journals.</p>
      <p>Correspondence forms the bulk of the collection, and is divided into four categories:
        personal, special, parapsychological, and business. The most voluminous is personal
        correspondence primarily from two of the Rhine's children, Sara (Rhine) Feather and Rosemary
        Rhine. Also included, however, are letters from other family members and friends.</p>
      <p>The special correspondence consists of selected correspondence files arranged
        alphabetically by the correspondent's last name. The correspondents include: Ella (Long)
        Weckesser, Louisa Rhine's mother; Sylvia (Weckesser) Newcombe and Miriam (Weckesser) Whaley,
        sisters of Louisa Rhine; and Barry S. Siegal and William R. Birge, friends of the Rhines,
        who were officers during World War II.</p>
      <p>The parapsychology correspondence includes letters from people in the United States and
        other countries who wrote to Louisa Rhine relating psychic phenomena either they or someone
        they knew had experienced. Some of these experiences were reported by Dr. Rhine in her
        publications.</p>
      <p>Business correspondence is chiefly from other scientists in the field of psychical
        research, information relating to the work and funding of the Foundation for Research on the
        Nature of Man, and information concerning the publication and translation of some of Louisa
        Rhine's works.</p>
      <p>The personal and business correspondence, reflects the Rhine's concerns about how psychical
        research would be carried out in the future. They wanted to make sure that an accurate
        accounting of the work that had begun at Duke under J.B. Rhine's guidance be told. To that
        end, Louisa Rhine worked during the last years of her life to finish the work recounting as
        she said <emph render="doublequote">J.B.'s attempt to find the 'something lost behind the
          ranges.'</emph> Her efforts resulted in <title type="simple" render="italic">Something
          Hidden</title> which was published posthumously in 1983.</p>
      <p>The business correspondence also describes the strained relationship between Duke
        University and the Rhines' work both at the Parapsychology Laboratory, when it was
        officially a part of Duke University, and later when the Laboratory was transferred into the
        Institute of Parapsychology under the auspices of the Foundation for Research on the Nature
        of Man.</p>
      <p>The writings series contains both parapsychological and other works. The parapsychological
        writings include a chronological listing of J.B. and Louisa Rhine's works and of critiques
        and reviews of works by and about them. Also included is information about the Anpsi Project
        (psychic abilities in animals); miscellaneous notes kept by Louisa and J.B. Rhine; an index
        to articles in the <title type="simple" render="italic">Journal of Parapsychology</title>
        (1937-1967); transcripts of interviews with J.B. Rhine; miscellaneous speeches, lectures,
        and articles relating to the work of the Rhines and others in the parapsychology field; and
        articles and memorials to honor J.B. Rhine after his death.</p>
      <p>Other writings include short stories and poetry by Louisa and J.B. Rhine; anecdotes
        relating to the Rhines and their children; and attempts by the Rhines to write a work about
          <emph render="doublequote">Our Life Together.</emph> There are some fragments of short
        stories by Louisa Rhine, some giving the author's name as <emph render="doublequote">Louise
          Long</emph> a pseudonym adopted when they lived in Massachusetts. One of them "In the
        Crucible of Life" is apparently a true story about Louisa and J.B. Rhine, although their
        names have been changed in the story. A note in this section by the Rhine's daughter, Sara
        (Rhine) Feather (denoted by SRF) tells something about her mother's writings.</p>

          <p>Divided into four subseries: personal, special, parapsychological, and business. The
            personal correspondence is primarily from the Rhines' children, but also includes
            letters from other family members and friends. It is arranged chronologically. The
            special correspondence is arranged alphabetically by the correspondent's last name and
            chronologically within those files. Correspondents' letters in the parapsychological
            category are divided into two sub-categories: 1) case studies, arranged by the
            correspondents' last name and 2) miscellany, arranged chronologically. The business
            correspondence is arranged chronologically.</p>
