        (FSA) was formed in 1937 as part of social and economic reforms following the Great
        Depression. Collection comprises 18 color photographs taken from 1939 to 1942 by FSA
        photographers Jack Delano (8 prints), Russell Lee (7) and Marion Post Wolcott (3). Between
        1937 and 1946, FSA/OWI photographers created over 175,000 black-and-white images, and only
        about 1600 color images using Kodachrome chromogenic film. Subjects in this collection are
        diverse and include sawmills in Georgia and Maine; a wheat field in Washington State,
        socializing at a rural fair in Pie Town, New Mexico; tobacco cultivation and a federal
        housing project in Puerto Rico; and a group of African Americans fishing near a cotton
        plantation in Mississippi. The prints are sized 10x13 and 11x14 inches, and were created in
        the 1980s by photograph collector Tennyson Schad using the dye transfer process. Acquired as
        part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</abstract>

      <head>The Farm Security Administration Project</head>
      <p>The Farm Security Administration (FSA) was created in 1937 under the Department of
        Agriculture, as part of the U.S. Federal government "New Deal" recovery programs following
        the Great Depression. Its main purpose was to minister to the needs of and improve the dire
        situation of impoverished rural people across the U.S. </p>
      <p>In support of this effort, the FSA hired noted photographers and oral history interviewers
        to promote FSA programs and to document economic and social conditions and natural
        landscapes of the U.S. and its territories, as well as to illustrate the still-present
        vitality of the United States in the aftermath of the Depression. Led by
        economist/photographer Roy Stryker, the project ran until 1942, when the FSA was dissolved
        and subsumed under the Office of War Information (OWI). Many of the photographers hired for
        the FSA continued their work under the OWI.</p>
      <p>Between 1937 and 1946, FSA/OWI photographers created over 175,000 black-and-white images,
        and only about 1600 color images using Kodachrome chromogenic film, at that time a
        relatively new technology. Among the FSA photographers were Jack Delano, Russell Lee, and
        Marion Post Wolcott, whose color images form this collection. </p>

      <head>Content Description</head>
      <p>Collection comprises 18 color photographs taken from 1939 to 1942 by Farm Security
        Administration (FSA) photographers Jack Delano (8 prints), Russell Lee (7) and Marion Post
        Wolcott (3). The prints are sized 10 x 13 and 11 x 14 inches, with image sizes ranging from
        6 1/2 x 9 3/4 to 10 x 13 inches. They were printed by photograph collector and gallery owner
        Tennyson Schad in the 1980s from original transparencies in the Library of Congress, using
        the dye transfer process. </p>
      <p>Subjects include industrial settings such as a Pennsylvania steel mill and a sawmills in
        Georgia and Maine; rural settings such as a wheat field in Washington State and grain
        elevators in Idaho; and photographs of people, including a group of African Americans
        fishing near a cotton plantation in Mississippi, and a gathering of white men in a rural
        Kentucky town. One sequence documents people mingling, saying grace, and serving food at a
        rural fair in New Mexico. There are several photographs of tobacco cultivation and a federal
        housing project taken in Puerto Rico, where photographer Jack Delano settled shortly after
        his FSA assignment. </p>
      <p>Together, these rare color images reveal the diverse subject and stylistic choices made by
        these notable photographers commissioned for the FSA project. </p>
