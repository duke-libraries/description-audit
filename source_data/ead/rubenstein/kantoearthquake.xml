      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Great Kanto earthquake struck the Japanese island of Honshu at 11:58 a.m. on September
        1, 1923. With a magnitude of 8.3 on the Richter scale, the earthquake leveled Tokyo and the
        surrounding areas of Yokohama, Chiba, Kanagawa, and Shizouka. Along with the destruction of
        buildings and land, the earthquake resulted in widespread fires, as many people had been
        cooking their lunch around the time that the earthquake struck. A simultaneous typhoon in
        Northern Japan led to high winds that caused firestorms in cities across the region. </p>
      <p>Estimated casualties from the earthquake and the resulting fires range from 100,000 to
        150,000 people. About 2 million people were left homeless. Over the next several years,
        Tokyo was rebuilt with stricter safety standards, and more parks were added to offer open
        spaces as refuges. In 1960, the Japanese government declared September 1 to be Disaster
        Prevention Day. </p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Materials in this collection include a mixture of formats documenting the aftermath of the
        Kanto earthquake. A set of 18 postcards, tinted with color in some cases, contain
        photographs of wrangled railroad systems, destroyed buildings, evacuees, and mass casualties
        from the earthquake. And additional 120 postcards with similar content, some with Japanese
        captions, were added in 2016. There is a photo-illustrated pamphlet, which includes black
        and white images of the devestated areas. Also included is a copy of <title type="simple"
          render="italic">International Graphic Magazine</title>, which includes reporting in
        Japanese as well as images from the disaster. This magazine appears to be missing its back
        cover. Two special issues of <title type="simple" render="italic">Daishinsai Shashin
          Gaho</title>, from September and October 1923, include photo illustrations of destruction
        along with early attempts at rescue and recovery. Finally, the collection includes two
        folded color maps of Tokyo and the affected area, and a scrapbook of newsprint and printed
        images from after the earthquake. The scrapbook has been bound as a folio, and its news
        articles are also in Japanese.</p>
