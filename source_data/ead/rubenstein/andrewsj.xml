        American photographer based in rural southern Virginia. Collection comprises 257
        black-and-white photographs and 39 oral interviews by Jesse Pyrant Andrews documenting rural
        and small-town life in the Piedmont plateau of central southern Virginia and northern North
        Carolina. Major themes center on the landscapes and people of the region; tobacco
        cultivation; the lives of farmers, war veterans and laid-off workers; local architecture and
        historic sites; traditional crafts and music; and new patterns of economics and society in
        rural Virginia. The materials also include a Vietnam War veterans manuscript memoir and
        numerous oral histories of veterans. Additional projects include documentary narrative about
        the southern Virginia Carter-Wooding families; views from an Amtrak train; and street scenes
        and portraits taken in New York City, California, and Massachusetts. Acquired as part of the
        Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</abstract>

      <p>Documentary photographer and oral historian Jesse Pyrant Andrews (b. 1949) has photographed
        the changing rural landscapes of Virginia and North Carolina and the lives of its
        inhabitants since the mid 1970s. His documentary projects include in-depth oral history
        interviews that provide an important context for his portraits of Virginia veterans,
        farmers, immigrants, and former textile mill workers. Andrews studied at the New England
        School of Photography in Boston, Massachusetts, working primarily with photographers Olive
        Pierce and George Dewolfe. He shoots 35mm black-and-white film which he prints in his
        traditional darkroom.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection comprises 257 black-and-white photographs and 39 oral interview recordings by
        Jesse Pyrant Andrews documenting rural and small-town life in the Piedmont plateau of
        central southern Virginia and northern North Carolina. Most of the images are portraits of
        farming families, immigrant workers, former textile workers, war veterans, musicians, and
        other local people, with scenes from homesteads, small towns, farms, and grave sites. Major
        themes include tobacco cultivation; the lives of war veterans and laid-off workers; regional
        architecture and historic sites; and traditional activities such as music-making, making
        handmade firearms, and working with leather. Together, the images and interviews speak to
        enormous changes in this rural Piedmont region as it transitions into the 21st century. </p>
      <p>Three bodies of work whose images are found in the Portraits and Virginia series are
        referred to by Andrews as the Veterans, Vietnam, and Carter-Wooding Projects. The first two
        document the lives and struggles of U.S. veterans of World War II and the Vietnam and Gulf
        wars, and includes many audio interviews. The second project, also accompanied by several
        oral histories, documents two Halifax County, Virginia families, the Carters and Woodings,
        and their rural property which dates back to an 18th-century Huguenot land grant. The
        materials also include a Vietnam War manuscript memoir. </p>
      <p>Additional photo projects in the collection document the lives of former textile workers
        (also accompanied by oral histories); a trip on an Amtrak train; and street life and people
        in New York City, California, and Massachusetts. </p>
      <p>Most of the photographs are accompanied by captions written by the photographer, commenting
        on the individuals, their life experiences, and aspects of local culture and society. </p>
      <p>Photographs from the series documenting tobacco farming, "13-Month Crop," were selected for
        a 2002 exhibit of Andrews' work hosted by the Rubenstein Library at Duke University. </p>
      <p>A large selection of photographs in this collection has been digitized and is available
        online as part of the Duke Digital Collections.</p>

          <p>Series contains 38 11x14 inch black-and-white (gelatin silver) prints exhibited at Duke
            University's Perkins Library, August 7-December 14, 2002. Andrews spent one tobacco
            farming season, April 2000 to April 2001, using a traditional film camera to document
            the lives of the people who were involved in cultivating tobacco on the Moore family
            farm in Pittsylvania County, Virginia. Images portray the white farm family members as
            well as migrant Latino farmworkers. Tobacco farming is such labor-intensive work that it
            is often called a "13-month crop."</p>

          <p>Series is made up of 18 11x14 inch black-and-white (gelatin silver) photographs, the
            majority of which feature portraits of Bill and Nat Davis, brothers from an established
            rural family from the Piedmont plateau region of Pittsylvania County in south-central
            Virginia. Images range from the landscapes and sites around this family farm to the
            portraits of the two brothers Bill and Nat. One includes a sister, Nancy Paige Davis.
            There are several images of Bill's burial and gravesite.</p>

            <p>Bill learned to braid leather when he was a child. His father did not want him to
              learn that craft so he would take the strands of leather under the covers of his bed
              at night and practice braiding simply by feel. He could do any sort of braid from the
              most simple to making what he called a "rosette," a round knot woven from 16 strands
              of leather, seemingly with no beginning or end.</p>

            <p>Bill was much older than Nancy. When she turned 18, she wanted to attend the nursing
              school at the University of Virginia, but their father refused to pay for her to go.
              Bill eventually saved enough money to send her and she graduated in 1941. She never
              returned to the farm except to visit and lived in Richmond until her death in 2005.
              This image was made during her last visit to see Bill.  She always referred to him as
              her <emph render="doublequote">angel</emph> and thus she was making a halo for
              him.</p>

            <p>Bill was a friend of my grandmother. When I was a child, she would take me with her
              to visit the Davis farm. I knew the Davises very well. They are all dead now, their
              farm sold and is now a high-end housing development. The Davis family was a real link
              to the past. They never got accustomed to the Twentieth Century. </p>

            <p>Bill would tan fresh deer hides to use in his leather work. He made a device which
              would split a hide into evenly sized strips for braiding. He made belts, sashes, hat
              bands, watch fobs, key holders, and guitar straps. He also did harness repairs and
              remade worn out shoes. But the first step in this process was to pick all the flesh
              off the hide. If left, the bits of flesh would attract insects to eat the hide and
              leave uncured spots on the finished hide.</p>

          <p>Series consists of 48 11x14 inch black-and-white portraits of individuals taken by
            photographer Jesse Pyrant Andrews in Virginia and North Carolina, with a few from
            Tennessee and California. Subjects include men and women, teenagers, and fathers and
            mothers with their sons, chiefly from rural areas and small towns. The series includes
            portraits of war veterans who served in World War II, Vietnam, and the Iraq War, and
            which form part of Andrews' Veterans Project (also incorporating his Vietnam Project).
            These portraits have accompanying biographical captions and oral history recordings. The
            portrait of Vietnam veteran Donald Wright is also accompanied by Wright's handwritten
            journal describing events in Vietnam and after the war.</p>
          <p>As portraiture is one of the photographer's favored formats, additional portraits -
            sometimes of the same people in this Portraits series - are found in other project
            series. </p>
          <p>Titles and original negative identifiers assigned by the photographer have been
            retained. Prints in this series are arranged in order as received.</p>

            <p>Born in 1919, Joe Thompson was the last of his generation to play American "old time"
              music, in a style which evolved among black musicians in the rural South as far back
              as the antebellum years. Joe's playing had a unique sound and rhythm, shaped by his
              association with older musicians in his childhood and by continuing to play with other
              black "old time" musicians throughout his life. His cousin Odell played banjo with him
              until his death. Joe Thompson was a veteran of WWII. Trained as a bulldozer operator,
              he told me that he "built roads and buried bodies from Normandy to Berlin." He worked
              in the former White Furniture factory in Mebane until his retirement. He died in
              2012.</p>

            <p>Sgt. Donald Wright's memoir begins in September 1968 with his arrival at Da Nang, and
              ends in 1973 when he re-enlisted. The narrative is sometimes non-linear, jumping from
              memory to memory. Wright recalls battles, operations, life and leisure at military
              bases and camps, civilians in the war, Viet Cong attacks, Viet Cong child soldiers, a
              mine sweep on Liberty Road, a court-martial murder case, being wounded in combat,
              bonding with other soldiers in the Army, religious reflections, thoughts of home, and
              homecomings. </p>
            <p>According to his memoir, Sgt. Donald Wright first served as squad leader in the 3rd
              Guard, 3rd Platoon, Alpha Co. 1/7 1st Marine Division; later, he was promoted to
              Corporal and became an MP (Military Police). Battles described in detail include
              Memorial Weekend Battle, Meade River, Lynn River, and the Tet Offensive.</p>
            <p>The memoir is handwritten, with edits and side commentaries. Two sets of loose pages
              describing other memories are laid in. Also included are a few patches and an undated
              memorial program for George Alfred Marks, Jr. (1945-1968), member of the 1st
              Battalion, 7th Marines Division, location of memorial is given as the Republic of
              Vietnam. Marks died there in November 1968 (Source: Find a Grave website, February
              2021).</p>

            <p>Colonel Gagliano joined the U.S. Air Force Nurse Corps in 1967. She served for 18
              years as a flight nurse in both the Pacific and Atlantic Aeromedical, accruing over
              2000 in-flight patient hours. This included six years in Vietnam, evacuating wounded
              servicemen to hospitals in other countries where they could receive the care they
              needed. These flights involved gruelling 24-hour days aboard a huge C-141 cargo plane
              which had been reconfigured with cots, IV poles, and other medical equipment to care
              for the wounded. Flights carried between 80 and 100 patients. They would fly from the
              Philippines to Saigon, then to Da Nang, picking up patients along the way; then to
              Guam, Hawaii, Japan, Alaska, and California, dropping off patients according to their
              needs, then return to the Philippines. They made two flights a week, typically. She
              later served as a flight nurse in Operation Desert Storm and in Afghanistan. In all
              those years, she lost only one patient. She also participated in the airlift of POWs
              from Hanoi in 1973, as well as in Operation Saigon Baby Lift in 1975, helping to
              evacuate several thousand orphaned children from South Vietnam, many of whom were
              children of American servicemen who had served there. Col. Gagliano was also an
              influential force in the creation and dedication in 1993 of the Women's Memorial in
              Arlington, Virginia. She retired after 26 years of service. Oral history accompanies

              sent to An Khe, participating in patrols in the Bong Son Plain in the Central
              Highlands. Later served as a machine gunner in the A Shau Valley, where he was wounded
              and also suffered from heat stroke. He was sent to the rear to recover. When he was
              sent back to his unit they were pinned down for a month by NVA artillery fire near
              Quang Tri, with little resupply, but finally relieved by repeated airstrikes on the
              NVA positions. "Any person who has been in combat and comes back suffers in some way

            <p>Joined U.S. Army in 1970, "because of a broken heart." Only 17 at the time, he
              altered his birth certificate to make him appear to be 18. After basic training, he
              was sent to Ft. Belvoir and trained as a truck and large equipment mechanic. He worked
              with the 17th Combat Engineers for 18 months at Ft. Hood, Texas. Was sent to Vietnam
              and was stationed at Cam Ranh Bay with the 577th Engineers. He was later made Sgt. of
              the Guard at Long Binh, in charge of five miles of perimeter around that base, the
              largest U.S. base in Vietnam, subject to daily rocket and mortar attacks and attempts
              by the NVA to overrun the base. After his time in Vietnam he spent nine more years in
              service, with tours in Germany and Korea. Was promoted to Warrant Officer and retired
              in 1983. </p>

              photograph Ralph Stanley while he and his band were playing at the Ferrum folklife

              outside in freezing weather under an open sided tent. He was not happy that he was
              expected to play under such conditions and was warming himself with a down comforter
              before autographing CDs. He said, however, that after so many years on the road, he
              had come to expect just about anything and that he was looking forward to a more

            <p>Wyatt Oakes farmed tobacco on his family farm in the Callands community of
              Pittsylvania County, Virginia. He served in the Korean conflict as an infantryman,
              1952-53. He would never consent to an oral history but was a great neighbor and grew
              beautiful tobacco. Mr. Oakes introduced me to Rogers Royal, another local tobacco
              farmer who still cured his tobacco with wood - the last farmer in Pittsylvania County
              to do so. (See portraits of Royal in the Virginia series) </p>

          <p>These 31 11x14 inch black-and-white gelatin silver images were taken by photographer
            Jesse Pyrant Andrews on November 19, 2010 during a train trip from New York City to
            Lynchburg, Virginia. Images were chiefly taken from the windows of the moving train and
            captured overpasses, traffic, graffiti, residential neighborhoods, train stations, and
            other urban landscapes. A few shots focus on train passengers and there is one of a
            railroad worker on the tracks, as well as the photographer's self-portrait.</p>
          <p>Prints are untitled; descriptions in brackets have been supplied by library staff. All
            of the photographs were printed in 2011 and 2012. Original print numbers assigned by the
            photographer have been retained, and each print has been given an institutional
            identifier. Prints are arranged in order as originally received.</p>

          <p>Comprises 61 11x14 inch black-and-white (gelatin silver) photographs scenes taken
            mainly in the Halifax, Virginia area; other locations include Danville, Virgilina, and
            Franklin and Pittsylvania Counties. Many of the portraits form part of the
            Carter-Wooding Project and the Veterans Project and are primarily of farmers and

          <p>A note from the photographer on the the Carter-Wooding project: "The Carter-Wooding
            project is something I started in the late 1990s, documenting the 'old Carter farm' in
            Halifax County, where I now live. The property was originally a 5000-acre land grant
            from King George, divided into five parcels and given to the five (then) Carter
            brothers. As was common at that time, the Woodings and Carters intermarried over several
            generations, thus the name. The Woodings were prominent early settlers in both Halifax
            and Pittsylvania Counties. The Carters were prominent Virginia settlers since the
            beginning. The land grant extended from the Banister river, which borders the north side
            of Halifax (town), northward up what is now Rt. 501. It was probably little more than a
            footpath then. There are two fragments of the land grant remaining, one of them being a
            200 acre parcel (the old Carter farm) and another smaller parcel located about a mile
            north of the other. One of them is owned by a friend of mine, who is in one of the
            photographs in the collection, an image of him standing in the doorway of the pack barn.
            His father is seated on the step in front of him. His father, Robert Wooding, died in
            2004, and took a great deal of history with him. His son, Robbie (my friend) still lives
            on the farm and still grows a little dark-fired tobacco."</p>
          <p>The prints are arranged in rough chronological order. Original titles, captions, and
            negative identifiers have been retained as assigned by Andrews.</p>

            <p>Reid Carter was a mechanic who worked primarily on pulpwood trucks. He lived with his
              mother in a cabin without running water or electricity. When she died in 1982, at age
              100, Reid lost his mind and was committed to a state mental institution in Staunton.
              He died a few months later.</p>

            <p>Ed Wemple grew up in Charlottesville and graduated from the University of Virginia.
              He wandered the country during the depression of the 1930s. He worked as a
              longshoreman in New York, in lumber camps in Oregon and eventually went to Mexico,
              where he became a heroin addict. He cured himself by walking from El Paso to the
              Oklahoma border. He returned to New York, where he lived until 1964, taking in the
              bohemian and jazz cultures and working at odd jobs. He returned to Charlottesville in
              1964 and lived there until his death in 1987. I lived in the same house with him for a
              year. He had not had a bath in nine years and spent his time reading and sleeping. He
              went by taxi once a week to the Alderman Library to replenish his book supply. A
              wonderful man who had endless stories to tell about his life. I regret that I did not
              record any of our conversations.</p>

            <p>Born Jan. 10, 1919 at Callands, Virginia. Grew up on a tobacco farm, enlisted in the
              Army in 1941, fought as an infantryman through North Africa, then as a Ranger through
              the Sicilian and Italian campaigns. Discharged November, 1945. Wounded three times in
              what he called "three years of continuous combat." As a Ranger he was usually at the
              forward most front of the fighting. He has suffered since his discharge with severe
              PTSD and alcoholism. In spite of that, as well as his physical wounds, he was a
              successful tobacco farmer until he retired in 1994. He lives on the same farm where he
              was born. Up to this time I have not been able to convince Mr. Aaron to agree to an
              oral history. When I made this photograph, he said, "I was a nice fellow when this
              picture was made (the portrait of himself he is holding), before I went overseas.
              Since then, I don't know, I just never have been the same." This is part of the
              Disabled Veterans series. </p>
            <p>The oral history interview with Aaron was completed in 2012.</p>

              Halifax County, Virginia. He learned to play the fiddle from his uncles, who taught
              him the American old time fiddle style, which preceded bluegrass. In the 1940s, as
              bluegrass became more popular, he taught himself to play in that genre. Earl played
              with many bands for almost 60 years.</p>

            <p>Sam Winstead is a 93 year old Marine Corps veteran of WW 2. He fought at Peleliu and
              Okinawa, more than 100 days of continuous combat which the Marine Corps archives
              describe as the most horrific fighting in the history of the Corps. In 2007, after
              decades of trying to find peace within himself and forgiveness for the Japanese he
              fought in those battles, he founded Americans For Peace, along with its adjunct
              Veterans For Peace, and began an annual event called Sam's Ride for Peace. Since 2010,
              he and others have travelled by bicycle from Raleigh, N.C. to Washington, D.C., an
              annual eight day ride to promote peace in the world, stopping at schools and community
              centers along the way to advance their message.</p>

            <p>This curing barn is unusual in that it is built with a cinderblock foundation and
              with framed walls, as opposed to the traditional log-bodied structures that typically
              had foundations of field stones, with mud daubing between the logs. This barn had been
              covered with cement stucco, much of which has fallen off, revealing cured but badly
              deteriorated tobacco still hanging from the tier poles inside. The sign in front of
              the barn reflects the sentiments of many of the citizens of Pittsylvania County, as
              well as surrounding counties, in response to the efforts of Walter Coles to convince
              the state legislature to allow him to mine a potential 119,000,000 pound deposit of
              uranium that lies under his land, on the Colonial-era estate known as Coles Hill,
              located about fifteen miles northwest of where this barn stands. </p>

              Wood, after he turned over a huge tractor while bush-hogging on an embankment a few

              on his way to the scene of the accident. Miraculously, Doug Wood was not seriously

            <p>Franklin County, Virginia, has long enjoyed the dubious, albeit somewhat romantic
              reputation as the "moonshine capitol of the world." Franklin County is where the now
              fabled "moonshine conspiracy" took place in the 1930s, the subject of Dr. Charles
              Thompson's book <title render="italic">Spirits of Just Men</title>. During that time
              almost everyone in the county was involved in one way or another in the production of
              white liquor, everyone from the county sheriff all the way down to small children, who
              often acted as lookouts and laborers at the numerous stills that dotted the
              mountainsides, well hidden in the rhododendron and mountain laurel groves. Shooting
              Creek Road (State Route 860) was where many of the stills were located, and runs for
              several miles between Rocky Mount, the county seat of Franklin County, and Floyd
              County, located to the west. </p>

            <p>Chef Steve Schopen opened the Molasses Grill restaurant in Halifax in 2005, and has
              had ten very successful years as owner and head chef of that business. Born in Kent,
              England, in 1957, Steve has cooked all over the world. Schooled in the classic French
              style, he went on to learn many different styles of cooking at the restaurants in

            <p>Mr. Martin celebrated his 90th birthday February 3 of 2016. Born in the Calloway
              community of Franklin County, Virginia, he moved to Danville, Virginia, at age 15 to
              work in the Dan River Cotton Mill. He lost his right arm in a hunting accident when he
              was 16, but continued to work at Dan River until his retirement in 1990. Before losing
              his arm he had been an accomplished guitar player, playing what is now referred to as
              "American old time music." After the accident, he learned to play the same tunes on
              harmonica, and continues to play three or four times a week with friends. He knows
              many of the old fiddle tunes and has a wonderful musical style, sometimes playing two
              harmonicas at one time to accommodate key changes in a particular tune.</p>

              again worked in a hotel kitchen. At eighteen, he and a partner opened the DeLuxe
              Barbeque Restaurant on 146th St. at 7th Ave. He operated that business for twenty
              years before moving back to South Boston to care for his elderly parents. Oral history

            <p>Robbie still grows "dark-fired" tobacco, a variety called Lizard Tail. Unlike
              flue-cured tobacco (Brightleaf), which is harvested leaf by leaf, dark-fired tobacco
              plants are cut low to the ground and the entire plant impaled on a standard tobacco
              stick, several plants to a stick. The sticks are then hung on the tier poles of the
              curing barn, just as with flue-cured tobacco. Once the barn is full, several small,
              smoldering fires are built on the interior dirt floor and the barn is shut up as
              tightly as possible. Robbie makes these fires of hickory and cedar wood. The heat and
              smoke from these fires dries and flavors the tobacco, a three or four day process. The
              result is dark-colored leaves and a strong smoky taste when the tobacco is smoked or
              chewed. Robbie sells some of his crop and sets aside a portion for his own use.
              Dark-fired tobacco has become less and less common since the industrialization of
              tobacco farming in the 1990s.</p>

            <p>Here are the small fires Robert Wooding sets in the barn to cure his dark-fired
              tobacco. Part of the smoke necessarily escapes from the cracks and holes in the barn,
              sometimes giving the mistaken impression that the barn is afire. When the growing of
              dark-fired tobacco was more common, fire departments sometimes got false calls
              reporting a burning barn.</p>

            <p>The Carter house was built in three sections, the first (middle) section around 1790.
              The front section was added about 1840, and the kitchen, a log-bodied room, was added
              in 1886. Legend has it that the huge rock chimneys flanking the original section were
              built by a woman, although her name is long forgotten. Robbie's grandmother, Elizabeth
              Carter, was the last permanent resident of the house. Robbie still uses the kitchen.
              The rest of the house is used as a guest house and family gathering place.</p>

            <p>This was the first farm sale I photographed. This sale was of the Easley homeplace,
              where my ancestor Pyrant Easley, born in 1742, settled and built his home in 1772,
              after leaving Halifax County, Virginia, where he orginally settled around 1764. He was
              a son of John Easley, who settled in Cumberland County, Virginia, circa 1735. The
              Easleys were Huguenots who fled France in the late 1600s, after Louis XIV revoked, in
              1685, the Treaty of Nantes, which had granted vast privileges to the Huguenots. More
              than 10,000 Huguenots left France for America at that time. Pyrant Easley the elder
              died in 1816, leaving the home and several hundred acres of land to his son, also
              named Pyrant, born 1805. The younger Pyrant's grandson, Robert Henry Easley, was my
              grandfather. Robert's brother, Jesse Pyrant Easley, for whom I am named, was living in
              the original homeplace on the farm when he died in 1975 at age 91, leaving no will.
              Consequently, the farm was sold at public auction. A cousin bought the property at the
              sale, and so it remains in the family still. No one now lives in the original house,
              but is is being well maintained by the fmaily. It is one of two early homes in
              Pittsylvania County that were built in an "H" configuration. The Pittsylvania Easleys
              have always farmed tobacco, and continue to do so even now.</p>

            <p>Originally settled by John Richmond Pearson. He married Alsee Boswell, born 1883.
              Alsee was the older sister of my maternal grandmother, Vivian Boswell, born 1903.
              Vivian married Robert Easley in 1920 (see notes regarding the Easley farm sale). The
              Pearsons had eleven children, most of whom stayed on the farm and raised tobacco. One
              son, Thomas was killed when he was struck by lightning while plowing with a mule. John
              and Alsee's children are all deceased, although some descendants still live on the
              farm. Tobacco is no longer grown on that land. The homeplace, scene of this
              photograph, burned to the ground in April, 2016.</p>

            <p>Ninety-six year old Robert Aiken was part of a unique division of men who were
              trained by the Army specifically for the planned invasion of Japan in 1945. Told in
              training that they could expect 75% casualties on landing, they were nevertheless
              willing to go through with their mission. Mr. Aiken is an exceptionally cheerful man
              who has spent his life helping other people. </p>

            <p>Born in 1947, Jim was the eldest son of Matthew Lafayette Aaron (see entry for
              earlier image). Because of a difficult birth, Jim was delivered with forceps,
              resulting in his having a minor deformity of his eyes. He also walked with a slight
              limp. Because the other children made fun of him, his father took him out of school
              after the first grade. He became his father's shadow and learned farming - how to grow
              a crop of tobacco, how to raise cattle, how to repair cars and machinery. Jim had an
              unfailing memory for details and loved Nascar and working with horses. After Mr.
              Aaron's death, Jim's health began to decline, and he died of congestive heart failure
              in 2015.</p>

            <p>Born in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, in 1892, "Swannie" Shelton was my
              grandmother's first boyfriend. He played the fiddle and banjo, and, along with my
              grandmother's four brothers, had a string band. They played at house parties, dances,
              corn huskings, barn raisings, and weddings...just about any occasion that called for
              music, playing what we now know as "old time." The band broke up when Giles Boswell,
              my grandmother's brother, who, according to Swannie, was "a first-rate fiddle player,"
              was killed in France at the second battle of Verdun. In the 1970s, my grandmother and
              I often visited Swannie at his barber shop in Gretna, where we would play a few tunes
              and the two of them would talk about "the old days." Swannie died in 1982. The street
              in Gretna where he had lived for years was named "Music Street" in his honor.</p>

            <p>Floyd Fox was born in 1905. He farmed for a while as a young man, then went to work
              on a railroad construction crew. When he injured himself in a fall from a bridge, he
              returned to the farm and opened a store "on the road" in 1932. He sold farm supplies,
              seed, fertilizer, food, had a bar with slot machines, and sold gasoline. He used to
              boast that he had the oldest ABC license in Virginia. He extended credit to his farmer
              neighbors, and when the CCC established a camp nearby, his business became a popular
              place for the men in the camp to come and relax in the evening... [see inventory in

          <p>These seven black-and-white portraits by photographer Jesse Andrews and the oral
            histories that accompany them form part of the Burlington Mills Project, which documents
            the lives of former employees of a Halifax, Virginia textile mill, and how they and

            <p>Whatever Lee believed, he has now become a symbol...signifying to some people an
              ancestral nightmare and to others an ancestral hero. Likewise the catchword "heritage"
              carries vastly different meanings depending on what one's ancestors were doing or
              having done to them 157 years ago. After he died, however, his image as a popular
              Southern hero overshadowed his own desire in life to put the past behind him. The tarp
              covering Lee's statue was removed in March of 2018 by order of Judge Richard Moore.
              The issue is still being debated by the Charolttesville city council.</p>

            <p>Hundreds of statues similar to this one were put up across the South by the UDC in
              the years just before WWI and in the 1920s. The Halifax County Courthouse is slated
              for extensive renovation which will drastically alter the historic façade of this
              building. Built in 1838 by Dabney Cosby, the building is on the National Reister of
              Historic Places. This statue will probably be removed as a part of the renovation.</p>

            <p>Built in 1790, Mountain View was the home of a lifelong friend, Steven Law, who died
              unexpectedly September 1, 2018. Mountain View was owned by generations of Steven's
              family. I spent many days and nights there in the 66 years I knew Steven. To be at
              Mountain View was to transcend time and place. He owned this 1960 Corvette, and drove
              it for many years, often exceeding 140 mph. He parked it in the yard at Mountain View
              in 2002, believing that if he continued his thrill-seeking it would eventually kill
              him. It is currently returning to the earth, as is Steven.</p>

              preserve Mountain View as it had always been. Plumbing and electricity were added by
              his parents in the 1930s. Otherwise it remains basically unchanged.</p>

            <p>Joe grew up in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He joined the U.S. Navy at age 17, served on
              a destroyer (USS Cory) and an aircraft carrier before volunteering for riverboat duty
              in Vietnam in 1967. He was assigned to the Mobile Riverine force at Dong Tam, an
              American base south of Saigon in the Mekong Delta, and served there 1968-1969. The
              Riverines served as support troops for the 9th Inf. Division, also based at Dong Tam,
              ferrying troops upriver to firefights and lending support, often going ashore to
              participate in the fighting when the 9th Inf. Troops got into a tight spot. Joe was a
              jack of all trades, serving in whatever capacity was needed, everything from fighting
              fires during the daily mortar and rocket attacks at Dong Tam to accompanying troops
              upriver. Discharged in 1969, he returned to Fort Lauderdale and worked as a postal
              carrier until his retirement after 29 years. Joe now lives part time in Fort
              Lauderdale and part time here in Halifax Co. He is a close friend. </p>

            <p>The house and land, 164 acres, did not sell at this auction since no bid was offered
              that met the owner's reserve. The personal property and household furniture were sold
              that day.   Stephen Burwell Law, who inherited Mountain View from his
              parents, left the property to his sister, Laura, who had not lived there since
              1968. Laura had no interest in living there and so put it up for sale. The house
              and land were sold by a realtor in September, 2020. The new owners have vowed to
              maintain Mountain View as closely as possible to its original condition, according to
              the stipulation Steve put forth in the directive he left with his will. Steve had
              maintained it for years, making every effort to retain its historic integrity.  He did
              not want Mountain View to fall into the hands of someone who would "modernize" the
              house by turning it into a bed and breakfast or a wedding venue. Laura did as he
              wished, and I know Steve would be glad that his wishes are being honored. </p>

            <p>Fox's was originally owned by Floyd Fox, Jr., and his brother Bill Fox. They were
              sons of Floyd Fox, Sr., who also operated a road house (see print in Virginia series).
              The Red Fox inn was a local watering hole and meeting place for many years. Jesse
              Pruitt was an extraordinary pool player and usually "ran the table" on anyone willing
              to challenge him - meaning that his opponent almost never got a shot - his challenger
              in this image can be seen sitting to the left, waiting to lose and pay up. Jesse would
              clear the table and walk away with the wager. </p>

            <p>A crossroads community, Ingram was once a thriving place, when tobacco was still the
              economic mainstay of the Old Belt region. This store was the center of the community's
              commercial activity, where just about anything was available - clothing, shoes,
              hardware, fresh meat and vegetables - whatever anyone might need. Credit was
              available, with no interest charged. If a farmer was cash poor, credit was extended
              until his crop sold in the Fall. The store was also a meeting place for the local
              residents to sit and play checkers and talk, or just visit and discuss the important
              topics of the day - weather, politics, who had the best-looking tobacco, who might
              need help with their crop. The loss of these community hubs has meant that in many
              places like Ingram, the people living there have grown less close and become busy with
              the mundane activities of more modern times - driving half an hour to buy what they
              could previously get at the general store, from people they don't know who work in
              businesses owned by people who are not local and only see customers as a source of
              profit. </p>

            <p>Here is the memorialized rebel, still overseeing the workers. During the summer of
              2020 a petition was drawn up to remove the statue either altogether or move it to a
              more appropriate place, such as the county museum. Hundreds of local residents signed
              the petition, but the county board of supervisors passed the buck (after pleas from
              the "heritage not hate" contingent), deciding to place the issue on the ballot in the
              next county election. Meanwhile, the 20 million-dollar plus renovation of the 1838
              structure continues. </p>
