			<abstract id="aspace_9698e4c1c1a07524bebfcf8193b52aad">Economist and faculty member at
				the University of Arizona specializing in experimental economics, price behavior,
				and game theory. The Vernon L. Smith Papers span the years 1938-2007, covering the
				majority of Smith's career as an economist in the United States, from his early
				collegiate work at the California Institute of Technology and Harvard through his
				professorship at the University of Arizona. Limited material also exists on
				consulting work and academic scholarship after he left the University of Arizona in
				2002. The collection is arranged in the following series: Correspondence, Electronic
				Files, Personal Files, Print Material, Professional Service, Research and Writings,
				and Teaching Material. Research topics include the development of a methodology for
				experimental economics; the implementation of experimental economics into the
				studies of asset trading, capital investment, game theory, environmental economics,
				price behavior, strategic decision making, and utilities; and economic
				decision-making, for which Smith was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in
				2002.</abstract>

			<head>Collection Overview</head>
			<p>The Vernon L. Smith Papers span the years 1938-2007, covering the majority of Smith's
				career as an economist in the United States, from his early collegiate work at the
				California Institute of Technology and Harvard through his professorship at the
				University of Arizona. Limited material also exists on consulting work and academic
				scholarship after he left the University of Arizona in 2002. The collection is
				arranged in the following series: <emph render="bold">Correspondence, Electronic
					Files, Personal Files, Print Material, Professional Service, Research and
					Writings</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Teaching Material</emph>. </p>
			<p>The bulk of the papers reside in the Research and Writings Series, which contains
				extensive files of Smith's research notes, reprints, and revisions of working papers
				by Smith and others with added annotations. Broadly speaking, the research files
				document important developments in experimental economics and Smith's seminal
				contributions to this field of study. Recurring topics in this series include the
				development of a methodology for experimental economics; the implementation of
				experimental economics into the studies of asset trading, capital investment, game
				theory, environmental economics (e.g., the allocation of natural resources such as
				water), price behavior, strategic decision making, and utilities; and the behavior
				toward as well as the psychology behind economic decisions, for which Smith was
				awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002. With his theories on behavioral and
				experimental economics, in part influenced by Leontief and Hurwicz, Smith analyzed
				the functioning of institutions and communication systems such as auctions, utility
				regulation and markets. An electronic version of Smith's <title type="simple"
					render="italic">History of Experimental Economic Science at the University of
					Arizona</title> is in the electronic files which have been migrated to a library
				server. The extensive Print Material Series includes reprints of the journal
				articles by Smith on similar material, many of which are also available through the
				Duke Libraries general collections.</p>
			<p>In addition to documenting Smith's work in theoretical economics, the Professional
				Service Series, Research and Writings Series and Teaching Material Series follow his
				professional activities primarily at the universities of Purdue, Brown,
				Massachusetts, and especially at Arizona; his role as the Research Director at the
				Economics Science Lab at the University of Arizona; his participation on various
				committees; his work with institutions such as the National Science Foundation, the
					<title type="simple" render="italic">Journal of Economic Behavior and
					Organization</title> and the National Academy of Sciences; and his role as a
				consultant on utility regulation both domestically and internationally. </p>
			<p>Finally, the Correspondence Series, contains primarily professional and academic
				correspondence concerning comments on his work by other economists; comments on
				other's work, dating from Smith's editorial work for several journals; and academic
				affairs, including recommendations and organizational letters for classes and
				seminars. Notable correspondence includes early exchanges with Paul Samuelson
				concerning Smith's graduate level work. In one folder of miscellaneous personal
				correspondence at the end of the series, a colleague speaks at length in several
				letters about the Cuban crisis and civil rights protests.</p>
			<p>Detailed descriptions on the arrangement and content of each series can be found in
				the respective sections in this collection guide.</p>

					<head>Scope and Contents note</head>
					<p>Contains professional and academic correspondence, chiefly from 1971-1999.
						Series contains routine academic correspondence, including recommendations
						for students and faculty, as well as other academic affairs; works of other
						economists; correspondence concerning Smith's publications; some discussions
						of economic theory and applications; and professional correspondence
						(including non-academic recommendations and job offers). The majority of the
						series falls into three main categories: comments on other economists' work,
						dating to his tenure as editor of several economics journals; comments from
						colleagues, referees, and other academics on Smith's works; and academic
						affairs (namely recommendations and routine organizational letters dealing
						with classes and seminars). Notable correspondence includes early exchanges
						with Paul Samuelson concerning Smith's thesis and graduate level work.
						Because the series deals mostly with professional and academic
						correspondence, there is little personal correspondence. Arranged in
						chronological order.</p>

					<p>Contains Vernon Smith's academic coursework as a student, clippings,
						calendars and planners, personal correspondence, and vitae. Academic
						coursework includes early course notes, papers, and entrance as well as
						final exams from Smith's student years at the California Institute of
						Technology; the Samuelson material concerns a seminar taught by Samuelson
						while Smith was pursuing a PhD at Harvard. The thesis appendix functions as
						an explanation of the theories in Smith's main text, utilizing the results
						of his economic work. Clippings chiefly deal with the awarding of various
						professorships to Smith, and the Arizona Stock Exchange. The interview,
						conducted for a book entitled <title type="simple" render="italic">Economics
							in Our Times</title>, explores the subject of experimental economics and
						Smith's role in the study of experimental economics. Arranged alphabetically
						by subject.</p>

						Reprints chiefly consist of articles written by Smith, or for which he was a
						contributing author. A large portion of the reprints are from a series
						published by the Purdue University School of Industrial Management Institute
						for Qualitative Research in Economics and Managment, which later became
						known as the Purdue University, Herman C. Krannert Graduate School of

					<p>Series is arranged into topical groupings: Games and Economic Behavior;
						Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization; National Academy of Sciences;
						National Science Foundation; Presentations and Seminars. These are followed
						by single folders in original order.</p>
					<p>Chiefly contains files on the contributions Vernon Smith made to professional
						associations such as the National Science Foundation, the Journal of
						Economic Behavior and Organization, and the National Academy of Sciences, as
						well as to the teaching profession, and to other associations. Contents are
						varied, and include information on workshops and presentations given by
						Smith at both the high school and faculty level, conferences he organized,
						consultancy positions he held, and professional association committee work
						he undertook. Other material on conferences attended by Smith can be found
						in the Research and Writings Series; also, many folders deriving from his
						undergraduate and graduate teaching can be found in the Teaching Series. In
						addition, because of the nature of his contributions to economics research,
						much of Smith's work for or with government or non-profit organizations such
						as his economic analysis of pollution and recycling for federal government
						agencies, is found in the Research and Writings Series rather than in
						Professional Service.</p>

						<head>Scope and Contents note</head>
						<p>This subseries consists of four parts: natural resources; utilities,
							electric; utilites, smart markets; and utilities, natural gas. Material
							on natural resources chiefly consists of proposals (mainly NSF),
							research and writings dealing with issues of exhaustible resources
							(land, oil and water) as well as resource preservation (recycling, waste
							accumulation and Exxon Valdez accident assesment). Also includes
							material for Smith's book <title type="simple" render="italic">Economics
								of Natural and Exhaustible Resources</title>.</p>
						<p>Material on electric utilities chiefly concerns the regulation and
							deregulation of electric companies and consists of articles, charts,
							clippings, drafts, and proposals. The principal regions researched
							include Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States
							(Alaska, California, Illinois, New Mexico but the majority refer to
							Arizona). The bulk of the files deal with work conducted at the
							Economics Science Lab; however, other partners in this enterprise
							include Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC); Federal Energy Regulation
							Commission (FERC); National Economic Research Associates (NERA);
							Department of Energy (DOE); National Science Foundation (NSF); Goldwater
							Institute; and various nationalized electric companies and government
							agencies.</p>
						<p>Material on smart markets concerns the network design for all utilities
							but primarily electric and natural gas. Major groupings of folders deal
							with research conducted for the industry in Hungary, and material for
							Smith's book on smart markets. </p>
						<p>Material on natural gas chiefly consists of data, drafts and research for
							Smith's work entitled <title type="simple" render="doublequote"
								>Experimental Auction Exchange for Pipeline Transmission
								Networks</title>. Research was conducted in conjunction with the
							FERC and Energy Information Administration (EIA). </p>
						<p>Box 174 includes unsorted material relating to Natural Resources and
							Utilities acquired through the 2013 accession.</p>

					<p>These documents derive from Vernon L. Smith's lengthy teaching career at
						institutions such as Purdue University, Brown University, University of
						Massachusetts, and University of Arizona. The series is divided into two
						subseries: Courses and Departmental. The subseries Courses chiefly consists
						of assigned readings by Smith and others, course notes, transparencies,
						student experiments, and exam subjects. The subseries also includes student
						essays, class lists, and graduate advising information. The subseries
						Departmental chiefly consists of committee meetings concerning issues of
						honors candidates, fellowships, faculty, and promotion and tenure. The
						documents are roughly arranged chronologically. Box 175 includes unsorted
						materials acquired through the 2013 accession.</p>
