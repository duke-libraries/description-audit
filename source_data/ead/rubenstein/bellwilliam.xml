         <abstract id="aspace_6c86ef55d6d1f9d559513fc0c5ccc8b3">William Bell was a photographer from
            Philadelphia. He was employed in 1872 by the U.S. Geographical and Geological
            Explorations and Surveys West of the 100th Meridian, a United States Army survey team.
            Collection includes sixteen gold-toned albumen prints, printed from negatives made by
            William Bell on the Wheeler Expedition of 1872. Fourteen photographs are from Arizona,
            two from Utah. Primary subjects include landscapes of the Grand Canyon and Colorado
            River. Some of Bell's photographs from this expedition were used for prints in George M.
            Wheeler's Report Upon United States Geographical Surveys West of the One Hundredth
            Meridian...(Washington: GPO, 1875-1889). In the field Bell prepared his own dry-plate
            negatives, a photographic process somewhat uncharacteristic for his time. he This
            process allowed him to store prepared plates longer than his contemporaries, who used
            wet plates, but would have also increased the exposure times for his plates.</abstract>

            aspects of his work except when they conflicted with more modern practices.</p>

         <p>In 1872, William Bell, a photographer from Philadelphia, found employment on a survey
            team established by the Army and formally titled: "U.S. Geographical and Geological
            Explorations and Surveys West of the 100th Meridian, under the command of Lieutenant
            George M. Wheeler." Bell had been hired by Wheeler to replace Timothy O'Sullivan,
            another expeditionary photographer, who participated in the Wheeler survey of 1871 and
            returned in 1873.</p>
         <p>Perhaps because William Bell participated in only one expedition, a limited amount of
            biographical information has been recorded for him, and that information is often vague.
            William Bell has most often been confused with another photographer Dr. William A. Bell
            (1841-1920) who served on the Palmer Expedition of 1867 for which William Jackson Palmer
            surveyed a route through the southwest for the Kansas Pacific Railroad. </p>
         <p>William Bell may have fought in the US-Mexican War and for the Union in the Civil War. </p>
         <p>Some sources have also indicated that William Bell was appointed chief photographer of
            the Army Medical Museum in Washington, D.C., where he may have made photographs of
            soldiers wounded in the Civil War. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>This collection includes sixteen gold-toned, albumen prints, printed from negatives made
            by William Bell while on the Wheeler Expedition of 1872. Fourteen photographs are from
            Arizona, and two are from Utah. The primary subjects of this collection are picturesque
            landscapes made of the Grand Canyon and Colorado River. Some of Bell's photographs from
            this expedition were used for prints in George M. Wheeler's <title type="simple"
               render="italic">Report Upon United States Geographical Surveys West of the One
               Hundredth Meridian...</title>(Washington: GPO, 1875-1889). This collection is
            composed of one series entitled the <emph render="bold">Wheeler Expedition of 1872
               Series</emph>.</p>
         <p>The government included photographers on western expeditions to make a visual record of
            the landscape and its inhabitants. The photographs created during these expeditions
            served to create maps used to plan for the construction of roads and railways; locate
            natural resources; facilitate future military operations; as well as to collect
            ethnographic information on and locate Indian tribes. Perhaps most importantly, the
            commanders of western expeditions used the resulting photographs as a public relations
            tool to gain support for future expeditions, and to record geological information, the
            study of which had become a popular science during the period. By the time of their
            completion, the surveys had explored much of the region between the Great Plains and the
            Pacific Coast. This recording made Bell and the other western expeditionary
            photographers some of the earliest participants in America's tradition of documentary
            photography.</p>
         <p> While in the field, Bell utilized a photographic process somewhat uncharacteristic for
            his time; he prepared his own dry-plate negatives. This process allowed him to store
            prepared plates longer than his contemporaries, who used wet plates, but would have also
            increased the exposure times for his plates.</p>
