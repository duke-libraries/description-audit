      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Nell Irvin Painter Papers span the years 1793-2019, with the bulk of the material
        dating between 1876 and 2007, and are primarily composed of the extensive correspondence,
        writing, research, teaching materials, and other professional papers that Painter has
        produced in her long career as a scholar, teacher, and writer in 19th- and 20th-century
        American and African American history. The materials document the breadth and depth of
        Painter's interests and her intellectual and personal influence on a generation of
        historians. Her varied roles as student, teacher, colleague, and mentor are recorded in a
        wide variety of formats: correspondence with colleagues, students, family, and friends;
        syllabi, department memoranda, and meeting minutes from her graduate and faculty positions
        at Harvard, Princeton, and the Universities of North Carolina and Pennsylvania; materials
        from many professional organizations in the fields of African American history, Southern
        history, American studies, and women's studies; and records of her speaking engagements,
        conferences, and meetings. Painter the historian and author are revealed in the extensive
        notes, photocopies, recordings, photographs, manuscripts, and proofs produced in writing
        many articles and five of her major books: <title type="simple" render="italic">Exodusters:
          Black Migration to Kansas after Reconstruction</title>; <title type="simple"
          render="italic">The Narrative of Hosea Hudson: His Life as a Negro Communist in the
          South</title>; <title type="simple" render="italic">Standing at Armageddon: The United
          States, 1877-1919</title>; <title type="simple" render="italic">Sojourner Truth, A Life, A
          Symbol</title>; and <title type="simple" render="italic">Creating Black Americans:
          African-American History and its Meanings, 1619 to the Present.</title> The portrait is
        rounded out by the materials in other series: personal files, which include materials from
        her student years at Harvard and abroad in Ghana and France as well as personal journals; a
        few papers of Ghanaian writer Ayi Kwei Armah; photographs, including many historical
        photographs of African Americans as well as many personal snapshots in color and
        black-and-white; and other non-print media such as audiotapes, audiocassettes,
        videocassettes, and computer diskettes.</p>
      <p>Painter's research files contain a wealth of information about many topics in American
        history: biography of African Americans; biography as a literary form; slavery;
        Reconstruction; the 1870s migration from the South to Kansas; a variety of social reform
        movements--such as abolition, communism, labor, and women's suffrage--and movers, such as
        Sojourner Truth and Hosea Hudson; and the history of social conditions and political change
        in the United States from the early-19th to the mid-20th century, particularly as expressed
        in race relations, in women's history, and in the South. At the same time, Painter's papers
        also constitute a contemporary record of many trends in American culture such as career and
        educational choices and opportunities for academic women and African American professionals.
        Her correspondence with students, colleagues, and longtime friends such as Nellie Y. McKay,
        her teaching material and academic files, her papers from an array of historians'
        organizations, and her personal journals each shed their own light on these themes. </p>
      <p>The collection is arranged in these series: <emph render="bold">Correspondence, Writings
          and Research, Teaching Materials, Professional Service, Personal Files, Photographic
          Materials, Audiovisual Materials,</emph><emph render="bold">Electronic Formats,</emph> and
        a collection of private papers collected by Painter, the <emph render="bold">Ayi Kwei Armah
          Papers.</emph> The first four series comprise almost eighty percent of the physical extent
        of the collection and are each divided into several subseries. The <emph render="bold"
          >Correspondence Series</emph> follows Painter's personal life, education, and professional
        career from her graduate years at Harvard in the late 1960s through her retirement from
        Princeton in 2004. </p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Writings and Research Series</emph> is arranged in seven subseries,
        the first five of which are based on five of Painter's major books; the final two subseries
        are <emph render="bold">Other Research Topics,</emph> which gathers many of Painter's
        shorter writings, and <emph render="bold">Writings by Others.</emph> With the exception of
        the last, all the subseries here contain correspondence with colleagues and editors;
        typescript drafts of works; various stages of proof; extensive photocopies of archival
        materials and published articles; voluminous notes about her readings and research; and some
        photographs and recordings, most of which have been removed to their respective series for
        preservation. </p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Teaching Materials Series</emph> documents Painter's work with
        students and academic colleagues at Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, the University
        of North Carolina, Hunter College, and Princeton University. It is arranged into two series:
          <emph render="bold">Courses Subseries</emph>, with syllabi, reading lists, and Painter's
        notes on the development of her courses that reflect the evolution of women's studies and
        African American studies in the curriculum; and the <emph render="bold">Academic Files
          Subseries</emph>, revealing Painter's many different roles over three decades: graduate
        student, job applicant, junior and tenured faculty member, dissertation advisor, mentor, and
        department head.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Professional Service Series,</emph> arranged in two subseries,
        documents Painter's activities in the broader academic community beyond her university of
        employment and her personal connections through materials from well over one hundred
        professional organizations, conferences, foundations, committees and task forces, as well as
        editorial boards of journals and publishers with which Painter has worked during her career.
        The <emph render="bold">Engagements Subseries</emph> gathers documents relating to
        addresses, speeches, and awards ceremonies at some three hundred conferences, meetings, and
        symposia.</p>
      <p>Five smaller series and a gathering of oversize material round out the collection. The
          <emph render="bold">Personal Files Series </emph> contains an assortment of records such
        as curriculum vitae; documents about her family; and some records of her student years,
        especially her travel and study in France and Africa. The series includes some three dozen
        personal journals covering most of the years from 1959-2005 containing entries about her
        life and career (NOTE: some journals are CLOSED to use; see details in the series note). The
          <emph render="bold">Photographic Materials Series</emph> contains several hundred
        photographs, negatives, and slides, predominantly personal and travel snapshots but also
        including professional portraits of Painter as well as a number of original photographs and
        reproductions of archival photographs she used in her research and writing. Much of the
        material in the early years of the <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials Series</emph>
        is related to her research and writing; by the 1990s, the content shifts focus to
        documenting Painter herself on the occasion of various interviews and addresses. The <emph
          render="bold">Electronic Formats Series</emph> consists of diskettes containing
        correspondence and drafts of writings. The <emph render="bold">Oversize Materials</emph>
        contains items from several series and subseries are gathered. The final series in the
        collection consists not of Painter's own work but that of a Ghanaian novelist and poet; see
        the <emph render="bold">Ayi Kwei Armah Papers (RESTRICTED)</emph> series note for further
        information on the provenance and usage of these materials.</p>
      <p>Unprocessed additions to the collection are listed at the end of the collection guide.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Note about date range of materials:</emph> The primary material
        produced by Painter begins around 1959 with her earliest journals. Earlier dates in various
        series, occurring mainly in Writings and Research, reflect the intellectual content and
        original publication of the large volume of reproduced research material present in the
        collection.</p>

          <p>Contains professional correspondence between Painter and her professors, colleagues,
            and students over the course of her career; personal letters to and from family,
            friends, and colleagues; and some administrative and interdepartmental memoranda from
            each of the universities at which Painter served as professor. Documents Painter's
            personal life, education, and career from her graduate years at Harvard in the late
            1960s up through her retirement from Princeton in 2004. Major figures who corresponded
            with Painter include African-American novelist Toni Morrison; professors of English
            Houston A. Baker, Jr., Werner Sollors, and Nellie Y. McKay; and historians Darlene Clark
            Hine and William L. Andrews. Theirs and others' correspondence may appear in either the
            Chronological Subseries or Alphabetical Subseries. Professional correspondence also
            includes some letters related to editorial matters, organizations such as the National
            Endowment for the Humanities, and such publishers as Heinneman of the African Writer's
            Series. Arranged in four subseries: the <emph render="bold">Chronological, </emph><emph
              render="bold">Alphabetical, </emph><emph render="bold">Student/Candidate Files,
            </emph> and <emph render="bold">Nellie Y. McKay (CLOSED).</emph>
          </p>
          <p><emph render="bold">Materials Retrieval Note:</emph> In addition to the material
            gathered in this series, Painter's extensive correspondence can be found in many other
            places in the collection. This is particularly true of the Writings and Research Series
            and the Professional Service Series. In the case of the former, each of the five
            subseries for Painter's major books contains a Correspondence subgroup within it related
            to research and publication of the book, and correspondence also appears in various
            folders throughout the other two subseries. In the Professional Service Series,
            correspondence appears in both subseries--Organizations and Engagements--though more
            substantially in the former. Thus in order to be sure of seeing all correspondence that
            might relate to a particular book, for example, patrons should retrieve not only the
            correspondence from that book's subseries in the Writings and Research Series, but also
            any boxes in the Correspondence Series that originate from any applicable time spans or
            persons in the Chronological and Alphabetical subseries, respectively.</p>

            <p>Correspondence between Painter and professors, colleagues, students, friends, and
              family over the course of her career. </p>
            <p> Arranged in chronological order by year, month, and, in some places, day. Where
              possible, Painter's own system of labeling has been retained, which accounts for some
              overlap in dates across folders. Materials from the mid to late 1990s and early 2000
              often have been divided into the categories <title type="simple" render="doublequote"
                >professional,</title><title type="simple" render="doublequote">business,</title>
              and <title type="simple" render="doublequote">personal</title> as Painter saw fit, and
              the folders containing these materials have been so labeled along with the year and,
              at times, month. Printed electronic correspondence was largely separated by Painter
              from traditionally-formatted letters when it first began to appear in the mid-1990s
              and has been retained in her folders; after a few years, however, she began to treat
              e-mail as any other correspondence and by 2002 was interfiling items regardless of how
              they originated. </p>
            <p><emph render="bold">Processing and retrieval note for 2008 and 2010
                accessions:</emph> There have been two substantial expansions of this subseries
              since the collection was originally processed in 2006. Materials from Accession
              2008-0016 were integrated into the subseries chronologically but not physically,
              meaning that newer box numbers will sometimes appear out of strict numerical sequence.
              Materials from Accession 2010-0116 were processed minimally, and can be found appended
              at the end of this inventory. Researchers are advised to examine all these points when
              seeking to retrieve all correspondence from a particular period of time, especially
              materials dated 1997 or later.</p>

            <p><emph render="bold">Sensitive Material:</emph> Materials covered by the privacy and
              confidentiality agreement signed by all researchers appear at many points throughout
              the collection, but they are especially concentrated in this subseries. During
              processing, all grades, social security numbers, and various medical information were
              removed or redacted when they were found, but this does not guarantee all such items
              were located. In addition, material such as letters of recommendation, commentary on
              students' writing or performance, and other potentially sensitive information appears
              and was retained in many folders. Researchers should review the confidentiality
              agreement or consult with Research Services staff if they have questions about the
              appropriate use of this material.</p>

            <p>Correspondence between Painter and Nellie Y. McKay, who met in 1969 when both were
              first-year graduate students at Harvard (Painter in history, McKay in English). McKay
              went on to become a professor of American and African-American Literature and
              published important works on Toni Morrison and Jean Toomer among other writers. She
              spent most of her career at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Bulk of subseries
              consists of correspondence from McKay, but several years into the sequence many copies
              of Painter's letters begin to appear, too. Letters cover the personal and professional
              lives of both women, enriched by a variety of attachments, including drafts of
              writings, newspaper clippings about their careers and current events, promotional
              materials, snapshots, and sometimes copies of correspondence with third parties.
              Arranged chronologically, although researchers should note that Painter's original
              labeling on the folders is not always complete. Often the correspondence inside the
              folders covers a longer span of months than she indicated; this has been amended in
              pencil, but items were not shifted between or within folders, so contiguous folders
              should be examined for particular weeks or months.</p>

          <p>Writings, research materials, notes, and correspondence that document the genesis of
            Painter's major books and many articles, essays, and reviews. Contains significant
            amounts of correspondence with publishers, sources, and colleagues; articles and talks
            sent by colleagues; and copious notes and numerous photocopies of primary sources,
            including newspapers and government records. There are also many drafts of Painter's
            talks and writings, including manuscripts, typescripts, and printer's proofs.</p>
          <p>Arranged in eight subseries, the first six of which are based on five of Painter's
            major books: <title type="simple" render="italic"><emph render="bold">Exodusters: Black
                Migration to Kansas After Reconstruction</emph>
            </title> (1976); <title type="simple" render="italic"><emph render="bold">The Narrative
                of Hosea Hudson: His Life as a Negro Communist in the South </emph>
            </title> (1979); <title type="simple" render="italic"><emph render="bold">Sojourner
                Truth, A Life, A Symbol </emph>
            </title> (1996); <title type="simple" render="italic"><emph render="bold">Standing at
                Armageddon: The United States, 1877-1919 </emph>
            </title> (1987); <title type="simple" render="italic"><emph render="bold">Creating Black
                Americans: African American History and Its Meanings, 1619 to the Present </emph>
            </title> (2005); and <title type="simple" render="italic"><emph render="bold">The
                History of White People</emph>
            </title> (2010). Each subseries is further divided into three subgroups, Correspondence,
            Drafts, and Research Materials; see specific subseries notes for further detail about
            the arrangement and content of these categories for each book. Materials unrelated to
            these five books--or whose relationship to them could not be established--have been
            placed in one of the final two subseries, <emph render="bold">Other Research
              Topics</emph> or <emph render="bold">Writings by Others.</emph> Note that while all
            the subseries contain writings by other authors, the main criterion for placing
            materials in Writings by Others is that the folder contains only such writing. If a
            folder contains Painter's notes and commentary in addition to writings by other authors
            or contains works by multiple authors that Painter gathered under a topical heading,
            then they are placed in one of the first five subseries or in Other Research Topics.
            This subseries, the largest in the Writings and Research Series, is further divided into
            subgroups by topic; see its subseries note for further details on its arrangement.</p>
          <p>Several types of documents that appear in this series are supported by related material
            in other series. Three are of particular note: correspondence, addresses, and writing by
            other authors. Much correspondence appears in various subseries in Writings and
            Research, and it addresses many of the same topics broached in the Correspondence
            Series; it can be searched alphabetically or chronologically according to the
            arrangement of the particular subseries. Drafts of Painter's addresses and articles have
            generally been placed in the Writings and Research Series--especially in the Other
            Research Topics Subseries--if the folders consist mainly of substantive drafts of the
            work or research on it; but other versions may also appear in the Engagements Subseries
            of the Professional Service Series. Finally, a substantial amount of writing by other
            authors, especially when those authors were current or former students or advisees of
            Painter's, appears in two other series. Most such material appears as attachments to
            letters in the Student/Candidate Files Subseries of the Correspondence Series; a smaller
            amount, in the form of drafts unattached to correspondence, appears at the end of the
            Teaching Materials Series, Academic Files Subseries.</p>
          <p>As mentioned in the Collection Overview, the dating of folder titles is of particular
            note in this series due to the large volume of photocopies and microform printouts of
            archival and historical material. If the folder contains Painter's notes or quotations
            from a primary source, the date corresponds to the time Painter worked on the subject.
            If the folder contains an original source or photocopy of one (almost always the
            latter), the date corresponds to when the intellectual content was originally produced
            or published.</p>

            <p>Materials have been organized into three subgroups, Correspondence, Drafts, and
              Research Materials. Correspondence also includes book reviews. The Drafts subgroup
              consists of typescripts and printer's proofs. Related writings and speeches by Painter
              are organized with the research materials. The materials in the Correspondence and
              Research Materials subgroups are arranged alphabetically, while those in the Drafts
              subgroup are arranged chronologically. Because they lack precise date information,
              three typescripts and three printer's proofs have been labeled A to C. This labeling
              does not reflect any chronological ordering among those documents. In the Research
              Materials subgroup, articles by Painter are indicated by (NIP); writings by others are
              listed alphabetically by last name. The designations "(d)" and "(w)" she occasionally
              places after the names of certain newspapers indicate whether it was a daily or weekly
              publication, respectively.</p>

            <p>Contains correspondence, readers' reports, drafts, interview transcripts, and
              research materials for <title type="simple" render="italic">The Narrative of Hosea
                Hudson: His Life as a Negro Communist in the South</title> (1979), as well as
              related talks and articles by Painter.</p>
            <p>Materials have been divided into three subgroups: Correspondence, Drafts, and
              Research Materials. The Correspondence subgroup largely consists of
              publication-related materials and correspondence between Painter and Hudson, which
              began in 1976 and lasted through 1982. Many of Hudson's letters contain newspaper
              articles that he routinely clipped, typed notes onto, and attached to the letter.
              Other items of note in the subgroup include readers' reports and Painter's replies to
              them and a letter of consignment for the Hudson interview tapes, which Painter donated
              to the Southern Oral History Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
              Hill, where they are housed in the Southern Historical Collection. </p>
            <p>The Research Materials subgroup largely consists of materials used in verifying and
              annotating the text. Hudson's FBI file is of particular interest. Also contained are
              several interview transcripts and related articles and talks by Painter, including her
              talk at UNC, <emph render="doublequote">How I Wrote <emph render="italic">Hosea
                  Hudson</emph>.</emph>
            </p>
            <p>The materials contained in the Correspondence and Research Materials subgroups have
              been organized alphabetically. The folder titles for articles or talks by Painter
              begin with the work's title, followed by <emph render="doublequote">(NIP)</emph>.
              Folder titles for works by other others are organized by author, last name first. The
              materials in the Drafts subgroup are organized chronologically.</p>

            <p>Contains correspondence, reviews, photos, comments from readers, and research
              materials for <title type="simple" render="italic">Sojourner Truth: A Life, A
                Symbol</title> (1996), as well as related talks and articles by Painter. Divided
              into three subgroups: Correspondence, Drafts, and Research Materials. The
              Correspondence subgroup includes materials regarding fellowships Painter received,
              reviews, photos, answers to questions regarding <emph render="italic">Sojourner
                Truth</emph>, publication information, and requests for others to review drafts of
              her chapters. These items have been ordered alphabetically.</p>
            <p>Painter sent a number of typescript chapter drafts to other scholars. The Drafts
              subgroup largely consists of the drafts that these scholars returned, with their
              comments and suggestions. The majority of the drafts are of the first three chapters,
              but a few copies of chapters four and five are also included. These items have been
              organized chronologically.</p>
            <p>The Research Materials subgroup largely consists of notes, articles, and photocopies
              of book chapters and letters. There are also a number of talks and articles by Painter
              in relation to <emph render="italic">Sojourner Truth</emph>. In particular, there are
              several folders with materials relating to the chapter <title type="simple"
                render="doublequote">Difference, Slavery, and Memory: Sojourner Truth in Feminist
                Abolitionism,</title> which appeared in Jean Fagan Yellin and John C. Van Horne's
                <emph render="italic">The Abolitionist Sisterhood: Women's Political Culture in
                Antebellum America</emph>. At the time the materials in the collection were
              prepared, the chapter was known only by its subtitle and the book was called <emph
                render="italic">An Untrodden Path</emph>. Also of interest is an article by Richard
              Powell, which is related to a chapter in <title type="simple" render="italic"
                >Sojourner Truth</title> on photography and representations of Truth. Other
              materials relevant to this topic, particularly cartes de visite, are found in the
              Writings by Others Subseries and the Photography subgroup of the Other Research Topics
              Subseries. The Research Materials subgroup has been ordered alphabetically.</p>

            <p>Consists of correspondence, drafts, related talks and writings, and extensive
              research materials related to Painter's work on <title type="simple" render="italic"
                >Standing at Armageddon: The United States, 1877-1919</title> (1987). Divided into
              Correspondence, Drafts, and Research Materials subgroups.</p>
            <p>Compared to other subseries, the <title type="simple" render="italic">Standing at
                Armageddon</title> Subseries contains relatively little correspondence. The existing
              materials are largely publication-related. The correspondence with the Henry George
              School of Social Science includes a lesson plan and quiz questions on <emph
                render="italic">Standing at Armageddon</emph>. Related correspondence perhaps may be
              found in the Correspondence Series. The Drafts subgroup includes a manuscript, several
              typescripts, and two master proofs. The Research subgroup materials include
              photocopies of scholarly articles, newspaper articles, and Congressional records, as
              well as extensive notes from those materials and books. The subgroup also includes
              talks, reviews, and articles by Painter. </p>
            <p> In addition to materials directly about the book, all materials in the Writings and
              Research Series involving the issues of labor, gender, and race, as they relate to the
              economic and political conditions of the late nineteenth and early twentieth
              centuries, have been incorporated into the <title type="simple" render="italic"
                >Standing at Armageddon</title> Subseries. The subseries also includes materials on
              the South that are relevant to the period addressed by <title type="simple"
                render="italic">Standing at Armageddon</title>.</p>
            <p>The correspondence and research materials are arranged alphabetically, while the
              drafts are arranged chronologically. Talks or articles by Painter have generally been
              identified by <emph render="doublequote">(NIP)</emph> following the work's title. As
              three typescripts of <title type="simple" render="italic">Standing at
                Armageddon</title> lack any date information, they have been labeled A to C. This
              labeling does not reflect any chronological ordering among those typescripts. In
              addition, inasmuch as their dating is uncertain, those typescripts have been placed
              after the other typescripts in the subseries.</p>

              <p>The largest subgroup in the Other Research Topics Subseries. Contains work that
                either did not fit within one of the other subgroups, or that was equally relevant
                to several topics. Includes materials that cover the general topics of racism and
                African-American history, as well as issues surrounding political correctness, race
                and money, and language. Of particular interest are the materials about the Somerset
                reunion, a reunion of all the families associated with a former slave plantation in
                North Carolina, and three fictional works of unknown origin.</p>

              <p>Materials compiled by Painter while working in the late 1980s with one of her
                students, Leah Hagedorn, on a reprint edition (never published) of the novels of
                Walter White, an early 20th century African American author and chief executive of
                the NAACP from 1929-1935. Subgroup contains copies of correspondence to, from, and
                about White; copies of his newspapers columns, fiction manuscripts, and other
                writings; and Painter's original correspondence, drafts, and notes about White's
                life and work. Arranged alphabetically based on Painter's original folder titles;
                descriptive words such as "correspondence" and "photocopies" were added as needed to
                clarify folder contents.</p>

            <p>Consists of drafts, published works, and lectures by family members, colleagues, and
              other individuals. Although Painter probably used these materials for her own
              research, they have been placed in the Writings by Others Subseries because they were
              unrelated to, or could not be particularly identified with, any of her major books.
              Moreover, they have not been included among the materials in the Other Research Topics
              Subseries, although they frequently include notes or marginalia by Painter, because
              Painter organized these materials in such a way that the work in each folder is
              primarily the work of a single author other than herself. Correspondence, including
              notes from those sending materials to Painter, can be found in some folders, and
              related material from some authors may also be found in the Correspondence Series.</p>
            <p>Significant topics covered in the subseries include feminism, photography, and the
              history of photography. Other materials on photography are found in the <title
                type="simple" render="italic">Sojourner Truth</title> Subseries and the Photography
              subgroup of the Other Research Topics Subseries. Of interest is a work by Painter's
              mother, Dona Irvin, about the members of Downs Memorial United Methodist Church. The
              work focuses on the lives of middle-class African-Americans rather than prominent
              figures or the underprivileged. Here entitled <title type="simple" render="italic">The
                Downs People,</title> it was published as <title type="simple" render="italic">The
                Unsung Heart of Black America: A Middle-class Church at Midcentury</title>.</p>
            <p>Materials in the Writings by Others Subseries are arranged alphabetically by
              surname.</p>

            <p>Departmental correspondence and memoranda, meeting minutes, university and department
              forms and invoices, printed materials, files on students for whom Painter served as
              advisor or committee member, student writings, and other materials. Arranged
              alphabetically by institution (Harvard, Princeton, University of North Carolina,
              University of Pennsylvania, and Wellesley College), then chronologically within those
              groups. At the end of the series are several folder groups that span Painter's years
              in various positions, arranged alphabetically by topic. The largest of these are
              Applications and Job Searches, containing correspondence and other documents relating
              to various positions and fellowships she sought at different times; and Student
              Writings, containing various papers, theses, and dissertations written by Painter's
              students. Note that student files gathered here are mainly writings that were found
              unattached to correspondence and represent only a fraction of such material; the bulk
              of her extensive correspondence with her students, including discussion and copies of
              their research and writing, is in the Correspondence Series.</p>

            <p>Documents relating to Painter's addresses, speeches, and honors at some three hundred
              conferences, meetings, and symposia over the course of three decades. Although drafts
              of some of these presentations appear here, most of the substantive drafts have been
              placed in the Writings and Research Series. This subseries is more a record of what
              topics she spoke on, what occasioned the event, and with what organizations she has
              interacted throughout her career. Arranged chronologically.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>Contains information about Painter's personal life and, to a lesser extent, her family
            and her professional career. Materials include copies of her curricula vitae through the
            years; awards and honors; biographical citations about her from various reference works;
            clippings; appointment calendars and telephone logs; information about a number of
            family members, especially her parents; class notes and other documents from her student
            years abroad in Ghana and France; and over three dozen of her personal journals. By far,
            the journals are the most substantive item in the series in both richness and quantity
            of information. In more than five thousand manuscript pages Painter records details of
            her personal and professional life and her thoughts about her writing for almost thirty
            years, up to 1989; there then follows a gap of nine years before the journals resume in
            1998, though in considerably less detail. Arranged alphabetically by category in the
            following folder groups: Biographical, Calendars and Contacts, Family and Friends,
            Journals, Student Years, and Other Personal Papers. Folders are then arranged
            chronologically in those categories with the exception of the alphabetical arrangements
            of Family and Friends and Other Personal Papers.</p>

              <p>Processor's note: three contact sheets with no positive identification other than
                place, but posters of individual Greensboro Five members and the presence of armored
                vehicles in some photographs indicate that this is likely the funeral for victims of
                the riot of November 3, 1979. See also possibly related material under "Ku Klux

            <p>Contains approximately 830 black-and-white photographs, 1730 color photographs, one
              hundred twenty-two 35mm slides, and many negatives. Consists mainly of personal
              snapshots taken by Painter and her family and friends. There are several early
              photographs of family members, including a 1914 print of her mother's family in Texas.
              After the late 1970s there are also a number of formal portraits and publicity
              photographs of Painter (noted as "NIP"). Arranged in two chronological sequences:
              additions to this subseries received in accession 2008-0016 were so extensive as to
              render impractical the virtual interfiling technique used throughout the rest of this
              finding aid. Therefore boxes 229-231 contain the personal photographs received in 2006
              and earlier, and boxes 275-278 contain those received in 2008. Note that the more
              recently received group is not only larger but also covers a longer span of years,
              beginning earlier and ending later.</p>
