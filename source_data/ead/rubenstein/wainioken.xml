      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Ken Wainio was born in Ukiah, California, about two hours north of San Francisco, in 1952.
        He began to write at age fifteen--having been influenced by the writings of the French poets
        Lautreamont, Rimbaud, and Nerval. He moved to San Francisco at the beginning of the 1970s to
        study at San Francisco State University with the Greek surrealist poet Nanos Valaoritis, and
        met the American surrealist poets Philip Lamantia and Stephen Schwartz. A couple of years
        later, in an informal "poetry class" being conducted in the home of Harold Norse, he met
        Thomas Rain Crowe, Neeli Cherkovski and Luke Breit--along with whom he would later help to
        resurrect <title type="simple" render="italic">Beatitude</title> magazine. Wainio was
        co-editor of issue No. 26 which appeared in 1977. During the 1970s, his poems were regularly
        published in Bay area literary magazines. With Jerry Estrin, Wainio was a founding editor of
        the surrealist publication <title type="simple" render="italic">Vanishing Cab</title>. After
        driving a taxicab for the entire decade of the 1980s, he moved to Glenhaven, California. His
        travels took him to Greece and Egypt, where he spent considerable time in the 1980s and
        1990s. His poems and fiction were published both in America and abroad in such journals as
          <title type="simple" render="italic">Nexus</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic"
          >Asheville Poetry Review</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">Litterature en
          Marche</title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">Gregas </title>in Montpellier,
        France. His books included <title type="simple" render="italic">Crossroads of the
          Other</title> (written in the 1970s and published in 1994), <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Letters to Al-Kemi</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">Starfuck
        </title>(a novel published on computer disk in 1996) and <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Automatic Antiquity </title>(a collection of poetry published in 2004).
        Wainio died on January 26, 2006.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The majority of the collection consists of drafts or manuscripts of Wainio's writings,
        which ranged from poetry to short stories to novels to plays. The condition of the drafts is
        fairly good, although many are incomplete or only excerpts of the text. There are many draft
        versions of <title type="simple" render="italic">Amorfos</title>, <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Letters from Al-Kemi</title>, and <title type="simple" render="italic">The
          Spiral Canyon</title>, which was later published by New Native Press as <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Starfuck</title>, Wainio's first novel. Small amounts of
        material exist for several poems, short stories, and plays.</p>
      <p>The remainder of the Writings, Manuscripts, and Drafts series includes some of Wainio's
        published works, present in both broadside form as well as in journals or other serials. Of
        note are the several issues of <title type="simple" render="italic">Beatitude</title>,
        edited by Wainio at one point, as well as two issues of <title type="simple" render="italic"
          >Vanishing Cab</title>, his own publication. Also in the series is a small amount of
        Wainio's artwork.</p>
      <p>There are over 30 journals present in the Journals series and they include diary entries,
        travel plans and notes, drafts of writings and poems, as well as sketches and artwork. They
        offer insight into Wainio's thought process as an author, as well as his methods of
        writing.</p>
      <p>The remainder of the collection contains correspondence, including a series of
        correspondence between Wainio and Thomas Rain Crowe; personal materials, including obituary
        information, some of Wainio's college papers, and other miscellaneous materials; and
        photographs, which are largely undated snapshots taken by Wainio during his travels through
        Greece and the United States.</p>
