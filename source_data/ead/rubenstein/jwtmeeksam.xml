         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Samuel W. Meek Papers span the years from 1917-1980, although the bulk of the
            material dates from 1945-1962 and a few items are undated. Samuel Meek served as Vice
            President in Charge of International Operations of the J. Walter Thompson Company from
            1930 to 1964. Working out of the New York office as the head of the International
            Department, Meek established offices around the world, provided continuing support and
            advice to the heads of these international offices, made policy decisions related to
            international operations, and served as a consultant to a number of U.S. government and
            private agencies concerned with international relations and commerce. The Series
            arrangement created by the J. Walter Thompson archivist reflects Meek's activities and
            has been retained. Several categories of material are included: correspondence, market
            surveys and research reports, letters, official documents (such as the records of Meek's
            military service), and the transcripts of talks.</p>
         <p>The International Offices Series, 1942-1964 and n.d. is comprised primarily of
            correspondence between Samuel Meek and the heads of J. Walter Thompson's international
            offices. The majority of the items relate to the offices in Vienna, Toronto, Paris,
            London, Rome and Tokyo. The work of the offices in Denmark, Argentia, the Caribbean,
            Greece, Holland, Mexico and Pakistan are less extensively documented. Market surveys and
            research reports are also included. In addition to Samuel Meek, correspondents include
            Robert M. Campbell, Wilfrid Sanders, Justin de Blank, Kevin Farrell, Virgil D. Reed,
            Denys M. Scott, James H. Page, and Harry A. Lee. Major clients represented include
            UniLever, Kodak, Nestles, Shell Oil, Cheesbrough-Pond's, Rowntree, Olivetti, Oneida,
            Nabisco, Schick, Campbell Soup, American Chicle Co., General Foods, Honeywell Co., and
            Sanyo-Scott.</p>
         <p>The International Department Series, 1930-1962 and undated is comprised of documents
            related to J. Walter Thompson's role as an international advertising agency. Included
            are a 1957 personnel directory, letters outlining interational operations policy, and
            the transcript of a 1961 interview with Stanley Resor related to the international
            aspects of the company.</p>
         <p>The International Marketing Series, 1954-1962 and undated, includes correspondence with
            and reports from a number of councils and agencies such as the Business Council for
            International Understanding, the U.S. Information Agency, and the U.S. State Department.
            Correspondence related to the planning of a Series of trade fairs, 1954-1961, is also
            included. This material documents the role that the J. Walter Thompson Company and other
            multinational businesses played in foreign relations in the era of the Marshall
            Plan.</p>
         <p>The International Correspondents Series, 1945-1962, includes correspondence and informal
            reports on advertising conditions in various European and Middle Eastern countries.
            Several of the items in this small collection seem to be preliminary evaluations
            designed to help Samuel Meek decide whether conditions were appropriate to the opening
            of a branch office in a particular locale. The correspondents seem to be acquaintances
            of Meek or simply knowledgeable individuals rather than J. Walter Thompson
            employees.</p>
         <p>The Personal Series, 1917-1979 and undated is primarily concerned with Samuel Meek's
            personal life: records of his military service, financial details of his retirement, his
            coat of arms, and other issues. A few items of correspondence with James Webb Young and
            information about Stanley B. Resor's death and the establishment of the Stanley and
            Helen Resor Fund for Economic Research at Yale University are included.</p>
         <p>The Miscellaneous Series includes several essays about advertising and a few other
            items.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
               <p>The International Offices Series spans the years 1942-1964, although the bulk of
                  the material dates from 1945-1960 and a few items are undated. The records consist
                  of correspondence and documents of market research done at the J. Walter Thompson
                  offices outside the United States. The majority of the items relate to the offices
                  in Vienna, Toronto, Paris, London, Rome and Tokyo. The work of the office in
                  Denmark from 1942-1962 and in Argentina, the Caribbean, Greece, Holland, Mexico
                  and Pakistan during 1964-1966 is less extensively documented. The correspondence
                  is primarily between Samuel Meek,Vice President in charge of International
                  Operations, 1930-1964, and the directors of the various branch offices. Most
                  letters and telegrams focus on the practical aspects of establishing and running
                  the offices in foreign countries: budgets, personnel issues, potential clients,
                  competition from other advertising agencies, and market research. Others deal with
                  the more personal aspects of a multi-national business: arranging gifts, meetings
                  and receptions for visiting dignitaries, assisting executives of J. Walter
                  Thompson and of client companies with their travel plans, letters of condolence
                  for the deaths of executives' family members, etc.</p>
               <p>A frequent topic of the correspondence is how to reduce xenophobia and to increase
                  the acceptance of an American advertising agency and U.S. products in the face of
                  the nationalistic climate in many of the relevant countries. During the 1940s, the
                  London office was preoccupied with counteracting German anti-British propaganda in
                  the U.S. </p>

               <p>The International Department Series is comprised of documents related to J. Walter
                  Thompson's employing an international advertising agency. A 1957 personnel
                  directory lists those employees of J. Walter Thompson with international
                  backgrounds. The <emph render="doublequote"> Policy Letters</emph> file includes
                  correspondence related to various international operations policy issues. Touched
                  on here are the undesirability of an apprenticeship system, identifying optimal
                  locations for agency offices, coordinating the international offices, volume
                  discounts for advertisements, possible conflicts of interest in assuming a new
                  client or product, training employees for foreign offices, producing speculative

                  may make certain products unacceptable in a particular country. One folder

                  the Mutual Security Agency and the U.S. State Department. The Agora Study, 1962,
