         <abstract id="aspace_20d5ea0883f69bebb4aee76fc4c30505">Vince Cianni is a documentary
            photographer based in Newburgh, New York. The Berlin series features photographs of East
            Berlin, the destruction of the Berlin Wall, and the reunification of Germany in 1990.
            The Poughkeepsie Mall and the Providence House Men's Shelter series both document urban
            culture and decay in the 1980s. The Weddings Series contains photographs from weddings
            (including some transgender) from the mid-1980s. The Brooklyn project features images
            and recorded interviews from Cianni's book, <title render="italic">We Skate
               Hardcore</title>, which relates to Hispanic American roller blade culture in the
            Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, mid-1990s. Cambodian kickboxing culture
            is explored in another set of photographs taken in 2004. The last series offers a set of
            oral history interviews of gays in the military, also related to a photobook by Cianni.

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Collection comprises photographs from six bodies of documentary work by Vince Cianni,
            New York-based photographer and author. Subjects focus chiefly on American culture,
            exploring wedding rituals, skateboarding and youth culture, urban decay, street
            photography, shopping mall society, men in shelters, and gays in the military. There is
            also a series on kickboxing in Cambodia, and a large set of oral history interviews with
            gay men and women in the U.S. military. Most of the prints are gelatin silver, but there
            are also some in color.</p>
         <p>Accession 2007-0072 houses a series of 224 black-and-white photographs depicting roller
            blade and Hispanic American youth street culture in the Williamsburg neighborhood of
            Brooklyn, New York, taken by Cianni during the 1990s and into 2001. Fifteen of the
            prints appear in Cianni's book, <title render="italic">We Skate Hardcore: Photographs
