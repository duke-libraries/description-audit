      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Sir Percy Molesworth Sykes (1867-1945), English military officer, diplomat, and explorer,
        is known for his accounts of the history and culture of Iran (Persia). In 1915 he traveled
        with his sister, Ella Constance Sykes, through the steppes and mountains of Central Asia, in
        what was then called Chinese Turkestan. Their experiences were recounted in the book <title
          render="italic">Through Deserts and Oases of Central Asia,</title> published in 1920 and
        written by Percy and Ella Sykes. Although it seems she took some of the photographs used for
        the book illustrations, it appears that all the photographs in the album in this collection
        were taken by Percy Sykes.</p>

      <p>Bound photograph album containing 48 photographs taken by Sir Percy Moleworth Sykes during
        his travels in a mountainous region of Central Asia, now the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous
        Region of China, with his sister, Ella Sykes. The gelatin silver prints measure
        approximately 4 1/2 x 6 3/4 inches and are window-mounted two to a page with calligraphic
        captions in white ink. Subjects include landscapes, strategic buildings such as forts and
        trading posts, and local Uighur, Beg, Kyrgyz, and Kazak people and their dwellings and
        animals, as well as British, Russian, Turkish, and Chinese people and officials. Specific
        locations in captions include Kashgar, the Tuman River, Yarkand, Khotan, Merkit, Bulunkul,
        the Pamirs, Tashkurgan, Muztagh Ata, Karakul lake, Tian Shan mountains, and Osh. The images
        are large, crisp, and rich with detail, offering views of a remote area and its culture
        during tensions in the decades following the Russo-Turkish War.</p>
      <p>Sir Percy and Ella Sykes co-authored a book based on this journey, titled <title
          render="italic">Through deserts and oases of Central Asia</title> (1920, available
        online), and many images in the photograph album were used as illustrations, and are noted
        in this collection guide. It is clear from the narrative written by Ella Sykes (Part I in
        the book) that she was also taking photographs during their travels, but according to the
        album's title statement, the images in this album all were taken by Percy Sykes.</p>
      <p>The folio photograph album (11 3/4 by 9 1/2 inches) is bound in half green morocco leather
        over green cloth boards, and comprises 25 pages with a calligraphic title page in white ink;
        the volume label inside front cover reads "Kodak Ltd series H album."</p>
