        Stryker photographs collection contains photographs, negatives, and contact sheets generated
        by the journalist then known as Deena Boyer during two trips to Cuba between July 1963 and
        July 1964, as well as exhibit prints produced in 2010. During her second trip to the island,
        Stryker interviewed and photographed Fidel and Raúl Castro as well as other major figures in
        the Cuban Revolution such as Che Guevara and Vilma Espín. Topics and photographic subjects
        include key members of the revolutionary government at work and relaxing; and life in Havana
        and in rural Cuba, focusing on shops, street scenes, rallies, farms, development projects,
        and schools. There is a draft of the book prepared for publication in Italian by Stryker
        about her Cuba trips. Stryker's original negatives were processed in Cuba by Alberto Korda,
        Fidel Castro's personal photographer. All of Stryker's negatives have been digitized and are
        available online. Acquired by the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Deena Stryker Photographs collection spans the dates 1963-1964 and contains photographs
        and related material from Stryker's time in Cuba as a journalist for <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Paris Match</title>. During her stay, she interviewed and photographed
        Fidel and Raúl Castro as well as other male and female leaders in the Cuban Revolution,
        including Ernesto <emph render="doublequote">Ché</emph> Guevara, Juan Almeida, Luis Crespo,
        Armando Acosta, Armando Hart Dávalos, Efigenio Ameijeiras Delgado, Faustino Pérez, Manuel
        Fajardo Sotomayor, César Escalante, Jesus Montane, Antonio Núñez Jímenez, Guillermo García
        Frías, Celia Sánchez, Ramiro Valdes Menendez, and René Vallejo. </p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Photographic Materials Series</emph> contains Stryker's contact
        sheets, prints, and negatives created during the one-year period; all the photographic
        material processed by Alberto Korda, Fidel Castro's personal photographer. Topics and
        photographic subjects include key members of the revolutionary government, male and female,
        at work and relaxing with family members; life in Havana, including neighborhood and street
        scenes, and post-revolution housing projects; political rallies and meetings; and daily life
        and work in rural Cuba, particularly farms, agricultural workers, development projects, and
        schools. There are also images of Afro Cubans, religious life, and photos of major events
        such as the Havana trial of accused Batista collaborator Marcos Alfonso in March 1964, and
        the capture of Cuban fishing vessels by the U.S. Coast Guard in Feb. 1964.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> contains letters of introduction to
        Fidel Castro from Stryker as well as one written by Sánchez and a diagram drawn by Raúl
        Castro. Stryker's analysis of the complexities of nascent post-revolution Cuba is captured
        in an Italian manuscript draft of the book she prepared for publication in Italy, housed in
        the <emph render="bold">Manuscript Materials Series</emph>.</p>
      <p>An addition to the collection consists of prints produced from the original negatives by
        documentary photographer Cedric Chatterley for a 2010 exhibit on Deena Stryker's work, with
        a few other prints used in the exhibit created by Alberto Korda in the 1960s.</p>
      <p>All of Stryker's negatives have been digitized and these images are available in their
        digital form. There are some prints and contact sheet images not represented digitally.
        Digital images and captions created by the photographer have been transferred to a library
        server.</p>
      <p>Acquired by the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</p>

          <p>Consists of contact sheets, prints, and negatives of photographs taken by Stryker while
            in Cuba from December 1963 to June 1964. Captions were created by the photographer. All
            photographic films were processed by Alberto Korda, Cuba's official photographer during
            the revolution. Series includes numerous photographs of Fidel Castro acting in his
            official role, speaking at rallies and parades, visiting farms, and awaiting the return
            of Cuban fishing boats detained by the U.S. government. In addition, Stryker documents
            Fidel Castro relaxing at home with friends, exercising, and writing. Other prominent
            revolutionaries and government individuals photographed include: Ernesto <emph
              render="doublequote">Ché</emph> Guevara, Juan Almeida, Luis Crespo, Armando Acosta,
            Armando Hart Dávalos, Efigenio Ameijeiras Delgado, Faustino Pérez, Manuel Fajardo
            Sotomayor, César Escalante, Jesus Montane, Antonio Núñez Jímenez, Guillermo García
            Frías, Celia Sánchez, Ramiro Valdes Menendez, and René Vallejo.</p>
          <p>Other photographs chronicle life in Havana, including Carnaval, as well as the Cuban
            countryside, particularly the Sierra Madre and Isla de Turiguanó, Bayamo, Camagüey, and
            Guamá. Two rolls of film document the damage to cane fields and villages in rural Cuba
            in the aftermath of Hurricane Flora in late 1963. Many of the contact sheets are
            annotated. Negatives, contact sheets, and prints are organized sequentially by film
            roll; uncategorized prints and prints without negatives appear at the end of the series.
            All of Stryker's negatives have been digitized and these images are available in their
            digital form. There are a few prints and contact sheets not represented digitally.</p>

          <p>Most of these black-and-white gelatin silver prints were produced by documentary
            photographer Cedric Chatterley expressly for a 2010 exhibit on Stryker's work. The
            prints were derived from Stryker's original negatives housed in this collection; others
            were derived from prints produced earlier by Alberto Korda. The prints in the first set
            (boxes 3-4) are in window mats and were the final selection chosen for hanging in the
            2010 exhibit. The rest of the prints (Box 5) are unmatted. In this box there is one set
            of 10 prints produced by Chatterley, with two duplicate sets; plus, The number of
            duplicates for an image is noted in parentheses following the original exhibit
            print.</p>

              <p>Carlos Rafael Rodriguez was a writer, economist and political protagonist whose
                activism crossed multiple phases of Cuban history. He participated in the overthrow
                of dictator Gerardo Machado in the 1930s; served as a Cabinet Minister under
                Fulgencio Batista in the 1940s and in 1958 negotiated an agreement between the Cuban
                Communist Party, of which he was a prominent member, and Fidel Castro in support of
                the overthrow of Batista. After 1959 he held various senior positions in the
                revolutionary government. Author Tad Szulc called him, "A most affable man of
                considerable learning and sophistication as well as a prolific writer, he has been
                Fidel's most valuable collaborator, politically and intellectually, since the 1959
                victory."</p>

              <p>A class at the Makarenko Teacher's Institute, founded as a training site for
                "revolutionary instructors." Many students were former participants in the 1961

                to teach more than 700,000 rural Cubans to read and write, reduced the country's
                illiteracy rate from 23% to 4%</p>
