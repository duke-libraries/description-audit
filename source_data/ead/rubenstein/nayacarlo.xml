            house 92 oversize mounted albumen prints of Venetian landmarks, taken by notable
            photographer Carlo Naya during the 1860s and perhaps into the 1870s. Handwritten

            bear the studio negative number. Subjects include well-known landmarks of Venice,
            including churches, palaces, canals, bridges, and piazzas, along with city monuments and
            statuary such as the Winged Lion of St. Mark. Other images show interior details such as
            tombs, bas-reliefs, altars, and grand staircases. Acquired as part of the Archive of

         <p>Carlo Naya was a noted Italian photographer born in 1816 in Tronzano Vercellese, a small
            town near Torino in the Piedmont region. He studied law in Pisa but soon took to
            photography. First operating in various places as a daguerreotypist, he moved to Venice
            in 1857 on the death of his brother, and he began working with photographer and printer
            Carlo Ponti; after a dispute with Ponti, Naya opened his own studio and the two became
            chief rivals. Naya later opened a larger studio on Piazza San Marco, and achieved
            international reknown as an architectural and scenic photographer. Using Naya's large
            stock of negatives of Venetian landmarks, his studio assembled fine souvenir albums for
            admirers of the city. Naya died on May 29, 1882, in Venice. His wife and her second
            husband continued to operate the studio until it closed in 1918. (Source: <title

         <head>Content Description</head>
         <p>These four bound albums house 92 oversize albumen prints showing images of Venetian
            architecture and artworks taken by notable photographer Carlo Naya during the 1860s and
            perhaps into the 1870s. The images were secured using the wet-collodion process on large
            glass plate negatives. </p>
         <p>The cloth-bound albums measure 18 1/2 x 15 1/4 inches and each contains just over 20
            prints mounted on hinged boards. The albums bear the English title "Venice" on the
            spines and covers, and are numbered I-IV. Album four reveals the large signature of a
            former owner - J.E. (John Edwin) Chase, an art collector and amateur naturalist of
            Holyoke, Massachusetts.</p>
         <p>Subjects favored by Naya for these albums are the churches, palaces, canals, bridges,
            and piazzas of Venice, along with city monuments and statuary such as the Winged Lion of
            St. Mark and the equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni. The photographer's focus is
            on the elements of design and light; the few small human figures present in most images
            are included for purposes of scale. Featured sites include: the Palazzo Ducale; Piazza
            San Marco and the Basilica di San Marco; the Bridge of Sighs (Ponte dei Sospiri); the
            Gran Canale; and the church of SS. Giovanni and Paolo. Many images show interior details
            such as tombs (Titian and several Doges of Venice), bas-reliefs, altars, and grand
            staircases. In short, albums such as these display the subjects most sought-after by a
            knowledgeable tourist, and may have served as visual encyclopedias for educational
            institutions.</p>
         <p>Nearly all the prints measure approximately 10 5/8 x 13 7/8 inches, each mounted on card
            stock with a handwritten caption below, the photographer's blind-stamp from his Riva
            Schiavoni studio, and the studio's negative number, which appears in the image. The
            captions are expressed in Italian with some English terms, and have been transcribed
            exactly as they appear, with a few errors retained. Only one sequence of images bears a
            date - 1865. There is a handful of prints with no negative numbers - these have been
            assigned an identification number starting with "UN." A few prints are signed by Naya
            (or Naija, as it is sometimes written).</p>
