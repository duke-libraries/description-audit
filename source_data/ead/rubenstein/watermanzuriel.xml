            Cranston, Rhode Island and served as a surgeon aboard several American privateers during
            the Revolutionary War. He relocated to Edenton, North Carolina after the war.
            Commonplace book, dated circa 1769-1774, appears to have been created by Zuriel Waterman
            and Sarah Dean. The name Sarah Dean appears on the inside cover, but many later entries
            written in a different hand are attributed to Zuriel Waterman. The book contains a
            number of excerpts, verse, and other writings including: "A Chronological Table of
            Epithets of the Kings of England," "Versus on Mr. George Whitefield," "A Short and True
            Description of North Carolina and its Inhabitants," and "Care for bite of a mad dog."
            Also included is a count of inhabitants in the colony of Rhode Island by locale and
            race, a sketch of the city of Troy, a petition of the Continental Congress to the King
            of England, and various religious and political writings.</abstract>
