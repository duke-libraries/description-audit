      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Edward Jenner, (born May 17, 1749, Berkeley, Gloucestershire, England—died January 26,
        1823, Berkeley), was an English surgeon and scientist who was the pioneer of smallpox
        vaccine, the world's first vaccine. </p>
      <p>Jenner was a country youth, the son of a clergyman. Because Edward was only five when his
        father died, he was brought up by an older brother, who was also a clergyman. Edward
        acquired a love of nature that remained with him all his life. He attended grammar school
        and at the age of 13 was apprenticed to a nearby surgeon. In the following eight years
        Jenner acquired a sound knowledge of medical and surgical practice. On completing his
        apprenticeship at the age of 21, he went to London and became the house pupil of John
        Hunter, who was on the staff of St. George’s Hospital and was one of the most prominent
        surgeons in London. Even more important, however, he was an anatomist, biologist, and
        experimentalist of the first rank; not only did he collect biological specimens, but he also
        concerned himself with problems of physiology and function.</p>
      <p>In addition to his training and experience in biology, Jenner made progress in clinical
        surgery. After studying in London from 1770 to 1773, he returned to country practice in
        Berkeley and enjoyed substantial success. In addition to practicing medicine, he joined two
        medical groups for the promotion of medical knowledge and wrote occasional medical papers.
        He played the violin in a musical club, wrote light verse, and, as a naturalist, made many
        observations, particularly on the nesting habits of the cuckoo and on bird migration.</p>
      <p>Smallpox was widespread in the 18th century, and occasional outbreaks of special intensity
        resulted in a very high death rate. Jenner had been impressed by the fact that a person who
        had suffered an attack of cowpox—a relatively harmless disease that could be contracted from
        cattle—could not take the smallpox—i.e., could not become infected whether by accidental or
        intentional exposure to smallpox. Pondering this phenomenon, Jenner concluded that cowpox
        not only protected against smallpox but could be transmitted from one person to another as a
        deliberate mechanism of protection. In May 1796 Jenner found a young dairymaid, Sarah
        Nelmes, who had fresh cowpox lesions on her hand. On May 14, using matter from Sarah’s
        lesions, he inoculated an eight-year-old boy, James Phipps, who had never had smallpox.
        Phipps became slightly ill over the course of the next 9 days but was well on the 10th. On
        July 1 Jenner inoculated the boy again, this time with smallpox matter. No disease
        developed; protection was complete. In 1798 Jenner, having added further cases, published
        privately a slender book entitled An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae
        Vaccinae.</p>
      <p>Early reactions to the Inquiry from the medical community and the general public were
        mixed. Members of the medical community, especially those with investments in the practice
        of variolation, tried to discredit Jenner’s discovery or stake their own claim to it. Jenner
        had especially acrimonious feuds with two London physicians, Dr. George Pearson and Dr.
        William Woodville. Pearson even gave evidence against Jenner’s 1802 petition to the House of
        Commons for recognition of his work on vaccination.</p>
      <p>Despite some people’s doubts about the safety and efficacy of Jenner’s smallpox vaccine,
        there was great demand for cowpox samples to conduct vaccinations in England and abroad.
        Jenner and other practitioners in England sent dried cowpox specimens sandwiched between
        glass to Europe and the United States.</p>

          <p>Collection also includes a manuscript diary (188 pages) maintained by Jenner in 1811
            and the Fall of 1812, primarily containing notes on his patients and their treatments
            for various illnesses, from syphilis to gout to heart ailments (including prescriptions)
            along with records of many vaccinations. There is a note of receipt of a letter (1812
            Sept 12) from Dr. Alex Crichton stating that vaccination flourished throughout the
            Russian Empire. Also contains reports on the dissection of organs from a cow, horse, and
            sheep, along with two sets of notations regarding diabetes, and one on "pulmonary
            affections." There are occasional notes with weather observations, recipes, lists of
            letters written, patient charges or payments, and a few comments on his house repairs
            using stucco. At the end of the volume are a number of poems and epigrams.</p>
