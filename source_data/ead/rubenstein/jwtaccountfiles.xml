            Thompson Company (JWT) is one of the oldest and largest enduring advertising agencies in
            the United States. The JWT Account Files spans the years 1885-2007, with the bulk of
            materials covering 1920-1995. It is an artificially-created collection of information
            about client accounts held by the JWT and provides information about JWT's management of
            its advertising campaigns. Additionally, the files document deliberations about such
            topics as media selection; markets and marketing; and target audience for individual
            advertising campaigns. The bulk of the materials, especially the older records, document
            clients managed by JWT's New York Office, but the work of other offices is also
            represented, including: Atlanta Office (Marine Corps); Chicago Office (Oscar Mayer,
            Kraft); Detroit Office (Ford); and San Francisco Office (Sprint). The collection
            includes account histories; research reports; memoranda; correspondence; printed
            material; clippings; brochures and pamphlets; product labels and packaging designs;
            original artwork and advertising proofs; slides; photographs; audiocassettes and
            videocassettes. Clients represented include Eastman Kodak; Ford; Ford Dealer
            Association; R.T. French; General Cigar; Hamm's beer; Handy Andy; International Banana
            Association; IBM; Kellogg; Kraft; Quaker Oats; U.S. Marine Corps; US Sprint; Warner
            Lambert; White Castle; and the 1964 World's Fair. More limited materials are available
            for other significant JWT clients, including: Burger King; Champion Spark Plug; Domino's
            Pizza; Lever Brothers; Northern Telecom; Oscar Mayer; Rolex; Standard Brands; and Scott
            Paper. Acquired as part of the John W. Hartman Center for Sales, Advertising &amp;

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The J. Walter Thompson Company (JWT) evaluated its progress through a systematic study
            of the performance of its client accounts. Among the tools used to gauge the success of
            advertising campaigns and the health of ongoing client relationships were the
            compilation of account histories. The earliest surviving efforts by JWT to document its
            account relationships include approximately one hundred account histories collected from
            1925-1926 by the Business Extension Department. The histories were prepared largely by
            Henry C. Miner, Jr. (JWT employee, 1925-1933) under the direction of Rae H. Smith (then
            a Representative and later Vice President and Director). From the 1920s through the
            1940s, JWT New York Office's Department of Information and Records compiled records
            particularly on New York Office clients, including account histories, label and
            packaging designs and other printed materials. Beginning in the mid-1950s, the New York
            Office Information Center collected newspaper and magazine clippings, inter-office
            memoranda, research reports, and publications for various clients. This practice
            continued through the 1980s.</p>
         <p>In addition to such institutional record-keeping practices, from the 1930s through the
            1950s, individual staff members also compiled account records, which were then
            transferred to the Information Center of the New York Office. Howard Henderson, Vice
            President and Manager of the Cincinnati Office, gathered correspondence, memoranda, and
            reports regarding three clients: Chesebrough-Pond's, General Cigar Company, and the
            United States Playing Card Company. John Monsarrat, a JWT Executive Vice President and
            Director, provided material for the Chesebrough-Pond's account file. Another JWT Vice
            President, William C. McKeehan, provided further material about the United States
            Playing Card Company account in the 1950s.</p>

         <p>The JWT Account Files spans the years 1885-2008, with the bulk of materials covering
            1920-1995. It is an artificially-created collection of information about client accounts

               <p>History of the World's Fair Account.</p>
               <p>In 1960, four years before opening day, the New York World's Fair Corporation
                  hired JWT as its advertising agency. Fair President Robert Moses believed that a
                  vigorous promotional campaign was necessary to ensure the desired attendance. JWT
                  placed the newly-hired Ted Royal in charge of the account, and for the next four
                  years he guided the campaign. The assignment had few precedents and literally
                  involved starting from scratch. Royal not only coordinated the advertising for the
                  Fair, he sold the idea to potential exhibitors, many of whom were long-time JWT
                  clients.</p>
               <p>Account Supervisor Ted Royal, a fifteen-year veteran of the advertising industry,
                  joined JWT in 1960 and almost immediately he was given the Fair account. He left
                  JWT in 1965 with the Fair as his only major project. William Banks, International
                  Fair Promotion Advisor for JWT, joined JWT after working for the United Nations.
                  Fluent in 10 languages, he advised a number of account supervisors working in
                  foreign markets.</p>
               <p>The account files included here were accumulated by Royal, and by the
                  International Fair Promotion Advisor for JWT, William Banks. They include
                  documents from past Fairs, as well as contemporary material.</p>
               <p>The files are arranged into two subseries--<emph render="bold">General
                     Files</emph> and <emph render="bold">Clients and Exhibitors</emph>--and
                  alphabetically by topic therein.</p>
