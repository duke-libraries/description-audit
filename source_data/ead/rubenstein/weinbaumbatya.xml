			<head>Biographical / Historical</head>
			<p>Batya Weinbaum is an artist, musician, poet, author, editor and professor. She was
				born Betty Susan Weinbaum in 1952 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Her parents, Barbara Hyman
				and Jack Gerald Weinbaum, were activists during the Civil Rights Movement and passed
				on much of their social consciousness to their daughter. </p>
			<p>Weinbaum received her bachelor's degree in Photography from Hampshire College in
				1976. After graduation, she traveled across Latin America working as a documentary
				photographer. While in Chile, she witnessed Salvador Allende's Unidad Popular
				socialist movement. These experiences led to the publication of her first book, The
				Curious Courtship of Women and Socialism (South End Press), in 1978. Her photography
				documents the struggles of women fighting for freedom on the world stage, most
				notably in South America, China and Israel.</p>
			<p>After returning to the United States, Weinbaum went on to receive her Master's degree
				from SUNY Buffalo in 1986, where she studied ethnomusicology and began painting and
				composing music based on myths about feminist utopias. Her theories about
				matriarchal music were published in the book Sounding Off! (Autonomedia, 1995). She
				became a member of the Vermont Composers Consortium and was an artist in residence
				at University of Illinois at Champaign Urbana. </p>
			<p>Weinbaum received a PhD from the Interdisciplinary American Studies Program (housed
				in the Department of English) at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in 1996.
				She conducted her dissertation research on Isla Mujeres, Mexico. She later published
				her thesis as a book, Islands of Women and Amazons: Representations and Realities
				(University of Texas Press, 2000). It was on Isla Mujeres that she gave birth to her
				daughter Ola Liota in 1992. The experience of having a child led Weinbaum to write
				several poetry collections, a collection of fiction titled Post Modern Motherhood,
				and found the Feminist Mothers and Their Allies Task Force in the National Women's
				Studies Association.</p>
			<p>In 1997, Weinbaum founded a peer-review feminist journal, Femspec, an
				interdisciplinary feminist journal dedicated to science fiction, fantasy, magic
				realism, surrealism, myth, folklore and the supernatural. From 1998 to 2003, at
				Cleveland State University, Weinbaum received her first tenure track position
				teaching courses in English and multicultural literature. She filed a wrongful
				termination suit against the University in 2004. The case was settled in January
				2006.</p>
			<p>Following the resolution of the case, Weinbaum taught as a peripatetic educator
				teaching speech and debate and organizing literary events in Ohio. She was also a
				visiting faculty member and curriculum adviser at Pacifica Graduate Institute from
				2006 to 2007. This position led to a teaching career based on distance learning at a
				variety of institutions including: Gaia University, Tiffin University, and SUNY New
				York. Weinbaum currently lives in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. She is still
				Editor-and-Chief of Femspec.</p>

			<head>Content Description</head>
			<p>This collection documents Weinbaum's personal life, education and professional life.
				The Batya Weinbaum papers are arranged into the following thirteen series: Legal,
				Correspondence, Press, Activities, Research and Scholarship, Art, Writing, Teaching,
				Photography, Print Materials, Journals, Family Memorabilia and Audiovisual
				Materials. </p>
			<p>The first series largely documents Weinbuam's lawsuit against Cleveland State
				University from 2004-2006. The second series contains correspondence primarily
				related to Weinbaim's teaching and publications, but also has personal
				correspondence and letters she exchanged with influential figures in various fields
				such as contemporary American literature, multiculturalism, women's studies, poetry,
				music composition and education. The third and fourth series include press and
				reviews related to Weinbaum's personal writings and artwork, as well as items
				associated with workshops, speaking engagements and other activities given or
				attended by Weinbaum. The next four series contain substantial materials related to
				Weinbaum's writing and research, including: drafts of her books, poetry, academic
				publications, artwork, music and materials related to editing and publishing the
				journal FemSpec. The Teaching series also encompasses syllabi and course materials
				used during Weinbaum's time as a graduate student instructor and as a professional
				at Cleveland State University and Pacifica Graduate Institute. </p>
			<p>The collection also includes an extensive Photography series, with
				photographs/negatives Weinbaum took professionally as a documentary photographer in
				South America and Mexico; fieldwork in China and Israel, as well as family photo
				albums and scrapbooks. The eleventh series contains several decades of journals,
				notebooks and sketchbooks. The Family Memorabilia series documents Weinbaum's
				relationship with her daughter, Ola Liota Weinbaum. The Audiovisual Materials series
				has electronic files in a variety of formats including: floppy discs, cassettes,
				CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs and VHS tapes. These files encompass Weinbaum's writing and
				material related to FemSpec. The contents of Weinbuam's hard drive are also
				described throughout the series where appropriate. Where possible, Weinbuam's
				original folder titles and descriptions have been retained. </p>
