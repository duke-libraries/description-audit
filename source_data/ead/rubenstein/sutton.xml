         <head>Walter Lee Sutton</head>
         <p>Walter Lee Sutton was born in 1863 in Wilkes County, Georgia. In 1886, he married
            Harriet (Hattie) Louise Wynn, also from Wilkes County, and they had ten children, two of
            whom died at an early age.</p>
         <p>Sutton attended school in Danburg, Ga., and in the early 1880s went to business college
            in Atlanta. Before he ran his own business he worked in the general merchandising
            business Sutton and Anderson, which was run by his father and uncle, and delivered the
               <title type="simple" render="italic"> Atlanta Constitution</title> to families in the
            area. From about 1888 to 1907, he was a partner with his brother-in-law, Thomas V.
            Heard, in the general merchandising business, Heard and Sutton, in Danburg. When this
            firm was dissolved about 1907, Sutton maintained the firm which continued as a general
            merchandising business under the name W. L. Sutton Company. Sutton was also a planter,
            cotton merchant, director of the National Banks of Wilkes, and a director of Pope
            Manufacturing Company of Washington, Ga.</p>
         <p>In addition, Sutton was a member of the Danburg Baptist Church, where he served on the
            Board of Deacons and as Superintendent of the Sunday school. He donated land for the
            consolidated school built in Danburg in the early 1920s, served as a trustee of the
            school, and chairman of the Board of Education of Wilkes County. He was active in the
            Democratic Party, member of the Woodmen of the World, and the Wilkes County Farmers
            Club. Sutton died in 1947.</p>
         <p>Information relating to the Anderson, Danforth, Sutton, and Wynn families is in an
            information folder filed at the beginning of the collection.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Walter Lee Sutton Papers span the period 1811 to 1947 with the bulk dating from 1883
            to 1939. Three generations of the interrelated Anderson, Danforth, Sutton, and Wynn
            families are represented in the collection. While the collection primarily focuses on
            Sutton, many of the earlier papers relate to his wife's family, the Wynns and Danforths,
            her paternal and maternal relatives respectively.</p>
         <p>The majority of the collection consists of courtship letters between Walter Sutton and
            Harriet (Hattie) L. Wynn (1883-1886), and ledgers and daybooks of the general
            merchandising businesses Heard and Sutton and W. L. Sutton. Therefore, the major
            strengths of the collection include its delineation of courtship customs in the 1880s
            and its depiction over a thirty-five period of a small general merchandising firm. While
            the correspondence spans the period 1811 to 1936, there are very few letters that date
            between 1814 and 1830, thereby leaving several years virtually uncovered in the
            collection.</p>
         <p>The general merchandising businesses of Heard and Sutton and W. L. Sutton sold a variety
            of items including farm implements, wagons, buggies, hardware, groceries, dynamite, oil,
            gas, clothing, and dry goods. Because of the time period covered by these accounting
            records, one can readily see the transition from “horse and buggy days” to the
            increasing influence of the automobile. Besides business records, the account books also
            contain a few domestic accounting records for the Sutton family. Regular customers
            include members of the Anderson, Sutton, and Heard families. In some there are details
            about employees, including the number of days they have worked or days missed. Other
            volumes include an estimate of the amount of lumber sold, the amount of hay cut, or
            which fields were used for cotton picking.</p>
         <p>Sutton's cashbook, 1907-1909, not only delineates the cash received and paid out, but
            also identifies several products Sutton sold. Some of these entries also include names
            of companies or persons from whom he received products. While there are separate account
            books for ice (1909 June-1910 Oct.) and cotton ginning (1908 Oct.-Feb. 1912), ice and
            cotton ginning accounts are also included in some of the other W. L. Sutton Company
            ledger and daybooks for other years.</p>
         <p>The daybooks commonly itemize lists of goods received. Volume 17 includes a list of bank
            deposits for the years 1922 to 1927, while in later years 1932 to 1939, bank deposits
            are typically recorded in the daybooks for the period covered by the daybooks. Also in
            volume 17, for the years 1923 and 1924, deposits are listed for merchandisers'
            accounts.</p>
         <p>In one instance, the ledger for the W. L. Sutton Company had been used earlier for
            another purpose. Volume 34 contains a list of debts and credits for merchandisers'
            accounts for the period January 1, 1936 to March 31, 1937, while at the front of the
            volume there are records for the Danburg Baptist Church Women's Missionary Society, 1910
            to 1921.</p>
         <p>Volume 37, “Cotton Accounting Book” (1920-1927) includes Sutton's accounting records for
            his work as a cotton merchant. The accounting records indicate that Sutton shipped
            cotton to various companies including: Barnett and Company, Athens, Ga.; Georgia Cotton
            Growers Co-op Association; Rowland Company, Athens, Ga.; Washington Warehouse Company,
            Washington, Ga.; and George W. Wright, Augusta, Ga.</p>
         <p>Loose materials, chiefly business receipts, were laid into several accounting books.
            Included are receipts from merchandisers who provided goods to the W. L. Sutton Company
            and from various warehouses and companies where cotton was shipped. There is also a
            contract for ice between W. L. Sutton and Pope Manufacturing Company indicating that
            Pope will sell ice to the W. L. Sutton Company.</p>
         <p>Other Sutton accounting records indicate that he sold lumber, kept accounts for the
            Dansburg School District Board of Education, maintained records for the buying and use
            of livestock, and kept a record of personal expenses.</p>
         <p>Additional financial records include a blacksmith account book kept by Samuel Danforth
            (1836-1838) and one for a boarding house in Washington, Ga. maintained by Harriet Brown
            Danforth (1857-1860). Promissory notes and a statement of receipts and disbursements for
            the estates of Samuel K. Wynn (Hattie's father) and Walter L. Sutton are among the other
            financial papers.</p>
         <p>Among the earliest letters is a series that begins during the War of 1812 and continues
            to 1814 between George Reab in New York and others concerning his military service.
            (Reab married Almira S. Brown in 1816 and is a great aunt of Hattie Wynn.) Letters
            concern whether Reab could be asked to bear arms against the British again since he had
            been held as a prisoner of war by them and had later been released on parole. Reab
            stated that he should not be asked to bear arms, invoking the French parole d'honneur as
            the reason, which is a pledge or oath under which a prisoner of war is released with the
            understanding that he will not again bear arms until exchanged. It is unclear from the
            correspondence whether Reab was successful. By April 1813 he had been appointed 3rd
            lieutenant in the United States 13th Infantry Regiment and by 1816 he had retired from
            military service. The collection contains a list of officers, including George Reab, Jr.
            in the 13th Infantry Regiment of the United States Army, which is dated July 31, 1812. </p>
         <p>Correspondence from Almira B. Reab during the 1840s to family and friends in New York
            and Vermont describe how she adjusted to life in the south. Originally from New York,
            she lived with her sister Harriet B. Danforth and her family in Danburg, Ga. at the time
            these letters were written.</p>
         <p>The collection contains three diaries, one kept by Harriet Brown Danforth and her
            daughter Emma. Harriet's entries (1858, Jan. 3-1859, Nov. 30) primarily denote when she
            attended church and in some instances the Biblical scriptures which were read, while
            Emma's entries (1860? Aug. 26-Dec. 13) concern teaching school. The other two diaries
            were kept by Walter (1885, Aug. 15-Dec. 23). Several entries relate to Hattie Sutton,
            while others concern the “liquor issue.” Miscellaneous financial information is found in
            them as well.</p>
         <p>Other items in the collection include minutes and bylaws of debating societies,
            1853-1855, including the Pine Grove Polemic Society, Philomathian Society, and the
            Sandtown (Sandtown was formerly known as Hyde) Polemic Society; an undated handwritten
            arithmetic book; miscellaneous poetry (1816, 1846 and undated); school notes; minutes of
            the Willis A. Sutton P.T.A. in Danburg, Ga.; Walter Sutton's Sunday School
            superintendent record book for 1891; obituaries for various Sutton and Wynn family
            members; several printed graduation exercise programs from Danburg High School; other
            miscellaneous writings; and a few photographs.</p>
         <p>Papers in the collection indicate that Walter Sutton was having financial difficulties
            in the late 1890s and early 1900s. In 1897 and later in the 1920s, he was reminded by
            his creditors that he had outstanding debts. Legal papers from the 1930s also indicate
            he was suffering from monetary adversities. A petition filed by the American
            Agricultural Chemical Society for non-payment of debts (1934, Jan. 12) was apparently
            paid off later that year by selling some of Sutton's land. The agricultural depression
            during this period was probably a factor in his economic downturn.</p>

               <p>Chiefly personal letters from members of the Danforth, Wynn, and Sutton families,
                  primarily containing news about family members, friends, and social activities. A
                  series of letters from 1812 to 1814 concern George Reab, Jr. The bulk of the
                  correspondence (1883-1886) is courtship letters between Walter L. Sutton and
                  Hattie L. Wynn before their marriage in 1886.</p>

               <p>Account books, including ledgers, daybooks, and a cashbook; personal and business
                  receipts; and promissory notes. The W. L. Sutton Company ledgers and daybooks
                  spanning the years 1907 to 1939 comprise the bulk of the financial papers (40
                  volumes). There are also three volumes containing records for the Heard and Sutton
                  Company in which Sutton was a partner with his brother-in-law Thomas V. Heard.
                  Each of the 43 Heard and Sutton and W. L. Sutton Company account books has been
                  arbitrarily numbered. Therefore volume numbers given below refer to those numbers.
                  Loose materials laid into these volumes have been removed and placed in
                  folders.</p>
               <p> There are four miscellaneous account books, 1884-1919, in which Sutton maintained
                  a variety of financial data for different products. For example, one of these
                  which reads “Lumber Book, 1915” on the outside also contains accounting records
                  for other products. Some of these account books include information pertaining to
                  both business and personal expenses.</p>
               <p> The series includes Samuel Danforth's ledger (1836-1838), one maintained by
                  Harriet Brown Danforth (1857-1860), and one pertaining to the estate of Samuel K.
                  Wynn (1907)</p>
               <p> The unbound financial papers, with the exception of the laid in materials from
                  the W. L. Sutton Company account books, have been placed in chronological order at
                  the beginning of the Financial Papers series. The account books that do not relate
                  to Heard and Sutton and the W. L. Sutton Company are filed next. The Heard and
                  Sutton and W. L. Sutton Company account books that will fit into boxes have been
                  arranged primarily in chronological order. Loose papers from several of these
                  volumes have been placed in folders next to the boxed account books. The volumes
                  which would not fit into boxes are located at the end of the boxed papers.</p>
