      <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>Born on November 22, 1912, Doris Duke was the only child of James Buchanan (J.B.) Duke, a
        founder of the American Tobacco Company and Duke Energy Company and a benefactor of Duke
        University, and Nanaline Holt Duke. Inheriting a bulk of her father's estate in 1925, which
        included Duke Farms in New Jersey, Rough Point in Newport, R.I., and a mansion in New York
        City, Doris was soon dubbed by the press as "the richest girl in the world." Although Doris
        did her best to live a private life, she carried on the Duke family's pattern of
        philanthropy by contributing to a number of public causes such as the arts, historic
        preservation, and the environment. Doris Duke died in October 1993 at the age of 80. In her
        will she left the majority of her estate to the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.</p>

            <p>This subseries contains 8mm, 16mm, and 35mm film reels and include an array of topics
              that reflect Doris' wide and varied interests and pursuits. The main themes in this
              subseries include travel, social events, life at her various residences, and
              documentation of historical events. Doris Duke travelled widely and the subseries
              includes footage of her trips to the Middle East, Morocco, and Europe. Also included
              is footage of the construction of Shangri La and visits to both Duke Farms and Rough
              Point at various times of her life. Doris' interest in and financial support of the
              performing arts is reflected in several films in the series including custom original
              prints of Egyptian dancer Nadia Gamal and Lebanese dancers (as part of the creation of
              the Near East Foundation) and extensive raw footage of Tahiti as part of her funding
              of jazz artist Syd Shaw's East West New Sounds production company. Of particular
              interest are the four 35mm negative nitrate reels of The Nazi Supreme Court Trial of
              the Anti-Hitler Plot from September 1944 to January 1945 which were likely given to
              Doris Duke when she was a war correspondent during the World War II.</p>

              as a gift or sent to her as a means to solicit financial support. Of particular
              interest are the tapes of Duke Gardens which were made for the benefit of Doris Duke.
              The unknown narrator explains to Miss Duke what plants are in the gardens and points
              out changes that had been made to the various gardens.</p>

            <p>Many of the recordings in this subseries are homemade and date from the 1930s-1940s.
              Besides collecting the commercial recordings of well-known jazz, gospel, and classical
              artists, Doris was also very interested in Hawaiian music and recorded many of these
              native songs live using recordings equipment likely kept at her Shangri La estate. She
              also recorded herself and friends practicing the piano and singing, parties, and
              recorded and collected radio broadcasts including the broadcast of KGU Radio Artists
              "The Story of James Buchanan Duke" from 1949. Also included in this subseries are
              original recordings of the Joe Castro Trio, Kitty White, and Calvin Jackson practicing
              with his quartet. Of particular interest are the original recordings of the Kahanamoku
              family and Sol Ho'opi'I who recorded Hawaiian songs for Doris when she wasn't "in
              residence" at Shangri La.</p>

              <p>Side 1 opens with band rehearsing "Fascinating Rhythm" and then ends abruptly. Man
                (presumably Calvin Jackson) describes Gershwin and the song and how it's going to be
                played. Band rehearses entire song. Jackson then describes the next song to be
                rehearsed, "S'Wonderful" by quartet consisting of Don McFadden on bass, Peter
                Appleyard on vibes, Jack McCrea on drums (and Calvin on piano). Side 2 Jackson
                announces they are going "back to Big Band" and describes "Love Walked In" and
                discusses the arrangement. Quartet plays song.Digital use copy is available in the

            <p>Many of the recordings in this subseries are homemade and date from the 1930s-1940s.
              Besides collecting the commercial recordings of well-known jazz, gospel, and classical
              artists, Doris was also very interested in Hawaiian music and recorded many of these
              native songs live using recordings equipment likely kept at her Shangri La estate. She
              also recorded herself and friends practicing the piano and singing, parties, and
              recorded and collected radio broadcasts including the broadcast of KGU Radio Artists
              "The Story of James Buchanan Duke" from 1949. Also included in this subseries are
              original recordings of the Joe Castro Trio, Kitty White, and Calvin Jackson practicing
              with his quartet. Of particular interest are the original recordings of the Kahanamoku
              family and Sol Ho'opi'I who recorded Hawaiian songs for Doris when she wasn't "in
              residence" at Shangri La.</p>

              <p>Contains three tracks. Track 1 is unknown singer presumably playing with the Joe
                Castro Orchestra. Sounds like it was recorded in a club. Songs include Ain't
                Misbehavin', Lady Be Good, More Than You Know, Boogie (instrumental), and Black
                Magic. Track 2 has a mixture of recordings including Middle Eastern or Indian music
                and man speaking in foreign language. Track 3 begins with man chanting, the switches
                to live recording of woman speaking to man in a foreign language. It sounds like
                they are in a public space.</p>

              <p>Contains three tracks. Track 1 is unknown singer presumably playing with the Joe
                Castro Orchestra. Sounds like it was recorded in a club. Songs include Ain't
                Misbehavin', Lady Be Good, More Than You Know, Boogie (instrumental), and Black
                Magic. Track 2 has a mixture of recordings including Middle Eastern or Indian music
                and man speaking in foreign language. Track 3 begins with man chanting, the switches
                to live recording of woman speaking to man in a foreign language. It sounds like
                they are in a public space.</p>

            <p>This subseries consists of audiocassettes which are a mix of original and commercial
              recordings. The original recordings are primarily of gospel artists and groups,
              including the Cleveland Church Choir and High Point Choir, which reflects Doris'
              interest in gospel music. Also included are live recordings of the Newport Jazz
              Festival. The commercial audiocassettes are primarily of a spiritual nature from the
              Self-Realization Church. Of particular interest is a presumed telephone interview with
              Howard Hughes conducted in the early 1970s and a live recording of the inaugural
              flight of the Spruce Goose in 1947.</p>

              <p>Cassette tape sent to Doris Duke from Edward Tabela, who was asking for Doris Duke
                to support him financially. All the parts of the melodrama are acted out by Mr.
                Tabela. Correspondence from Mr. Tabela to Doris Duke is in Box 377 of the Doris Duke

                1947 inagural flight of the Spruce Goose. This is followed by with the live audio of
