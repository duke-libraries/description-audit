        correspondence and printed materials. There are also three unidentified and undated
        black-and-white photographs, along with a few items representing the Livingston family,
        including a genealogy developed by Helen Thomas Blackwell. The correspondence contains
        mostly routine letters to Blackwell family members from other family members; including
        Alice Stone Blackwell, Anna M. Blackwell, Elizabeth Blackwell, Emma Blackwell, Helen
        Blackwell, Henry B. Blackwell, and Lucy Stone. There are also several postcards mailed to
        the <title>Woman's Journal</title> regarding subscriptions, address changes and other
        matters related to publication, or the editor's business acquaintances. There are several
        printed materials written by Blackwell authors, including "Philosophy of Re-Incarnation" by
        Anna Blackwell, and "Medicine &amp; Morality," "Scientific Method in Biology," and
        “Erroneous Method in Medical Education" by Elizabeth Blackwell. However, the series
        primarily features printed items that were maintained in the Blackwell family library. Also
        contains a corrected typescript (1940s) of Ishbel Ross' <title>Life of Elizabeth
          Blackwell</title> along with notes from 1958 on the Elizabeth Blackwell award at Smith
        College.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Samuel Blackwell, a sugar refiner and lay preacher, emigrated to the United States from
        England in 1832, with his wife Hannah (Lane), eight children, and a governess. Their
        youngest child was born in New York City; they moved to Newark, N.J., then to Cincinnati,
        Ohio. Of the nine children, three are represented in this collection, Anna Blackwell, the
        poet, translator, and journalist; Elizabeth Blackwell (1821-1910), the pioneering physician;
        and Henry B. Blackwell (1825-1909), an editor, journalist, and businessman. Also represented
        is his wife, suffragist Lucy Stone, and their daughter, Alice Stone Blackwell. In addition,
        there are materials from Lucy's niece, Emma Stone Lawrence, who eventually married George
        Washington Blackwell, another of the nine children of Samuel and Hannah Blackwell. There are
        items from their daughter, Anna M. Blackwell, who went on to marry Charles Belden, librarian
        of the Massachusetts State Library, in 1908, as well as from Helen Thomas Blackwell, who
        married Anna’s brother, Howard.</p>

              <p>Material comprises a letter Blackweel wrote to an unidentified gentleman, probably
                between 1880-1895, following her retirement from the medical profession. During this
                time, Blackwell was actively involved in many different reform movements, including
                women’s rights, antivivisection, sanitation, and moral reform. This letter contains
                Elizabeth Blackwell’s lengthy critique of William Ewart Gladstone’s 1886 Irish Home
                Rule Bill. Blackwell’s letter begins: ‘Dear Sir, No one desires more strongly than
                I, that a just system of Irish government should be substituted for the unjust
                “Castle” system. I therefore profoundly regret that Mr. Gladstone has not been able
                to see that his present scheme destroys the Imperial Parliament, and insists upon
                treating the absence of Irish members as a “detail.” I can only hope therefore that
                the Govt. Bill will be thrown out, and that no member supporting it, will be
                returned to Parliament.” William Ewart Gladstone, served as Prime Minister four
                separate times: (1868–1874, 1880–1885, February–July 1886 and 1892–1894). In early
                1886, Gladstone proposed Irish Home rule but this was defeated in the House of
                Commons in July. Four other pages of undated notes on the topic accompany the
                letter. Includes a transcript for the letter.</p>
