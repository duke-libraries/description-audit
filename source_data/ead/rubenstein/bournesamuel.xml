            albumen photographs taken by commercial photographer Samuel Bourne and other partners as
            they traveled to sites in modern-day India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Burma. Of the 646
            prints in the collection, 200 are mounted in three large bound commercial photograph
            albums, while the remaining 446 are single, loose prints; all were published by the firm
            Bourne &amp; Shepherd. The majority of the prints range in size from roughly 6x9 to
            10x12 inches. Subjects include the vast landscapes of nothern India; landmarks such as
            temples, rivers and canals, monuments, mountain hostels, and European-built cathedrals
            and civic structures; rural scenes from villages and tea plantations; and scenes from
            the cities of Delhi, Bombay (Mumbai), and Calcutta (Kolkata). There are also several
            dozen ethnic portraits of native inhabitants and group portraits of English officials
            and Indian counterparts. A number of images have been attributed to Bourne's partners
            Charles Shepherd and Colin Murray.</abstract>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>Samuel Bourne (1834-1912) was born in Shropshire, England, and began his career in
            photography around 1855. Bourne sailed for India in 1863, settling in the northern city
            of Shimla, which served as the launching place for the lengthy trips he took to regions
            of modern-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Burma. One of his trips was devoted to
            finding and photographing the source of the Ganges in the Himalayas. He co-founded the
            Bourne &amp; Shepherd studio, which eventually had offices in Simla, Calcutta (Kolkata),
            and Bombay (Mumbai). Some of the images in the collection may also be the work of an
            earlier studio, Shepherd &amp; Robertson, formed by Bourne's eventual partner Charles
            Shepherd. In 1870 Bourne returned permanently to England with his wife, Mary; Charles
            Shepherd also left India in 1879. </p>
         <p>Most Bourne &amp; Shepherd studio negative numbers above 2200 are considered the work of
            studio photographers following Bourne's departure in 1871. Colin Murray, in particular,
            seems to have been Bourne's photographic successor; Bourne gave him all of his
            equipment. Further, following Bourne and Shepherd's departures, Colin Murray was hired
            as chief photographer and then became the firm's manager. </p>
         <p>Back in England, Bourne became a businessman and magistrate, passing away in 1912. Colin
            Murray died in Calcutta in 1884. The firm Bourne &amp; Shepherd closed in 2016; up until
            then it was one of the oldest photography firms in the world in continuous operation.
            The thousands of glass plate negatives Bourne had left behind were destroyed in a fire
            in 1991.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Collection consists of mid- to late 19th century albumen photographs taken by commercial
            photographer Samuel Bourne and other partners in the Bourne &amp; Shepherd as they
            traveled to sites in modern-day India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Burma. Some of the
            early images in the collection, circa 1861, may be the work of a predecessor studio,
            Shepherd &amp; Robertson. Most Bourne &amp; Shepherd studio negative numbers after 2200
            are considered the work of studio photographers following Bourne's departure in 1871; in
            particular, Colin Murray is considered Bourne's successor. </p>
         <p>Of the 646 prints in the collection, 200 are mounted in three large, fine photograph
            albums published by the studio Bourne &amp; Shepherd, while the remaining 446 loose
            prints are either loose or mounted on thin board. </p>
         <p>Subjects in the collection include the vast landscapes of northern India; landmarks such
            as Hindu temples, bridges, rivers and canals, monuments, forts, mountain hostels, and
            European-built cathedrals and civic structures; rural scenes of villages and
            newly-established tea plantations; newly constructed railroads; and scenes from the
            cities of Delhi, Bombay (Mumbai), and Calcutta (Kolkata). Nearly every scene features a
            few human figures carefully posed for scale or atmosphere. Also present are a series of
            group portraits of English officials with their Indian counterparts, and group portraits
            of Indian royalty. There are also several dozen portraits of native inhabitants produced
            as part of the ethnic studies common to the late 19th century; most have been attributed
            to Bourne's partner Charles Shepherd. Many of these group studies were published in the
            eight-volume <title render="doublequote">People of India</title> (1868-1875), and indeed
            most of the portraits in this collection are on pages taken from these volumes.</p>
         <p>The majority of the prints range in size from roughly 6x9 to 11x14 inches, with most
            around 10x12 inches, but a handful are smaller cartes-de-visite sizes. The images were
            secured in the field, often under extreme conditions, using the wet-collodion process to
            produce glass plate negatives, typically 10x12 inches. Some of the prints were cropped
            as ovals or in other shapes, but most are rectangular in form. Judging from their
            backings, many were previously mounted in albums or books.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Negative numbers and titles for the 546 images in the collection are transcribed
                  from the original Bourne &amp; Shepherd studio lists, which have been re-assembled
                  in recent years by historians of photography in India. The original spellings and
                  punctuation have been retained. Where there are gaps in those lists, the titles
                  and numbers are taken from studio inscriptions on the negative or print, or from
                  uncropped prints in other collections. The negative numbers, up to four digits
                  long, have been used to create each print's unique identifier. There are some
                  prints for which the negative numbers or titles are currently unknown; those
                  without a known number have been given a unique identifier composed of UN and a
                  sequential number (e.g., UN042).</p>
               <p> The three large brown leather and gilt albums are titled <title
                     render="doublequote">Northern India</title>; <title render="doublequote"
                     >Western, Eastern, and Southern India</title>; and <title render="doublequote"
                     >Farther India.</title> They hold a total of 200 albumen prints, 191 of which
                  are large-format (from 8x10 to 9x12 inches), mounted one per page; one exception
                  is nine cartes-de-visite mounted on a single page. </p>
               <p> The loose single prints are either unmounted or mounted on thin stock in most
                  cases. Typical image sizes range from 7x9 to 10x12 inches, and if the prints are
                  mounted, they are secured to thin stock typically measuring 9x11 to 11x14 inches.
                  Almost all the single prints are housed in modern 16x20 inch window mats. </p>
               <p> Many but not all of the prints in the collection are inscribed with negative
                  numbers, short titles, and variants on the studio or photographer's name. The
                  prints in the three albums are presented in random negative number order, but in
                  the collection guide the entries for all the prints, loose as well as
                  album-mounted, are listed in the same sequential negative number order as they
                  appear in the studio's commercial list.</p>
               <p> Specific locations featured in the images include but are not limited to: Agra;
                  Benares (Varanasi); Bombay (Mumbai); areas of Burma (Myanmar); Bhurtpore
                  (Bharatpur); Calcutta (Kolkata); Darjeeling; Delhi; Futtypore Sikri (Fatehpur
                  Sikri); Gwalior; Kashmir; Lucknow; Madura (Madurai); Mussoorie; Nepal; the
                  Neilgherries; Ootacamund (Udagamandalam); Rangoon (Yangon, former capital of
                  Burma); Secundra; and Simla (or Shimla). There are a handful of images featuring
                  posed groups of high-ranking Indian officials and nobility, as well as group
                  portraits of male and female native inhabitants, often accompanied by descriptions
                  of their ethnic group on a leaf of text. Calcutta image #1748 features the Samuel
                  Bourne's wife, Mary (Tolley) Bourne. Otherwise there are very few images of
                  Europeans in the collection.</p>

                     indicative of a later printing by the studio, after 1870. May be the work of

                     This includes the "late Dr. Campbell" (d. 1874), the Selim Tea Estate (est.
                     1871), and the Darjeeling Railway (built 1879). These images are probably by
