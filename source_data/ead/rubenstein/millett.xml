    <abstract id="aspace_ec9de2f594130a5865f69c94de1013c9">The Kate Millett papers document Millett's life and activities as feminist writer, theorist, and artist, teacher, and global activist, based in New York City. They also document the 20th century women's movement, feminist theory, as well as feminism and women's rights around the globe, especially in France, Italy, and the Middle East. There are many files of correspondence with family, partners, friends, writers, artists, and activists, including significant exchanges with Rita Mae Brown, Phyllis Chesler, Alix Kates Shulman, Yoko Ono, and Gloria Steinem. Annotated manuscripts and other items related to her major publications are present. Topics in these works include prison systems; mental institutions; psychiatry, medications, and mental health; torture and imprisonment; politics, gender, and sexuality; and mother/daughter relationships. Subject files contain research on these topics, as well as materials on abortion, feminism, organizations, the arts, gay rights, and Millett's diagnosis of bipolar disorder, involuntary clinical treatments, and subsequent involvement in anti-psychiatry activism. Additional series relate to writings by other authors; Millett's work as a visual artist and her New York State artists' colony; and her student years and teaching. Other formats in the collection include electronic records, chiely writings; many recordings of interviews, lectures, speeches, art openings, and conversations; photographs; artwork, including drawings, sculptures, and installation components; and print materials such as articles, cards, clippings, fliers, magazine issues, and posters. Acquired as part of the Sallie Bingham Center for Women's History and Culture at Duke University.</abstract>

    <head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The papers of Kate Millett provide rich documentation of Millett's activities as a feminist activist, artist, and author of numerous works, including <title type="simple" render="italic">Sexual Politics</title>, whose publication established her as one of the founding 20th century feminists. Other works for which supporting materials exist are <title type="simple" render="italic">The Loony-bin Trip</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">Flying</title>, and <title type="simple" render="italic">The Basement</title>. </p><p>Seen in a broader context, Millett's papers provide important documentation of the history of the feminist movement and feminist theory in the United States, including the history of the National Organization for Women. Materials in the collection also cover feminism and the social conditions for women around the globe, especially in France, Italy, and the Middle East - most notably Iran, where Millett traveled in 1979-1980.</p><p>The earliest dates in the collection, 1912 and 1928, refer respectively to an early family photograph, and historical resources used when writing the book <title render="italic">A.D.</title>. The bulk of the materials span her adult life from the 1950s through the early 2000s.</p><p>The collection content reflects the intensely personal nature of much of Millett's work and the frequent fusion of her personal, political, and professional interests, strongly evident in the many files of personal and literary correspondence, including significant exchanges with Ti-Grace Atkinson, Rita Mae Brown, Phyllis Chesler, Andrea Dworkin, Cynthia McAdams, Yoko Ono, Alix Kates Shulman, Gloria Steinem, and many other activists, writers, artists, friends, partners, and family. </p><p>Additional series include writings by other authors; papers documenting Millett's work as an artist and instructor; files relating to her New York State farm and artists' colony; materials from Millett's student years, including her thesis which led to the book, <title render="italic">Sexual Politics</title>; and scripts and other papers relating to Millett's little-known documentary film, <title type="simple" render="italic">Three Lives</title> (a copy of the film also exists in the collection). Other materials document her relationship with her mother during the last years of her mother's life, also the topic of her book, <title type="simple" render="italic">Mother Millett</title>. Subject files relate to Millett's involvement with the gay and lesbian communities, her research on prisons and torture, and her diagnosis with bipolar disorder and subsequent involvement in anti-psychiatry activism. There are also extensive printed materials such as serial issues, articles, clippings, posters, fliers, mainstream and grassroots newsletters, event programs, and manifestos. </p><p>Audiovisual materials, many available through digital access copies, include audio and video recordings of Millett's lectures, speeches, and many conversations with activists, friends, and family. There are also many photographs, slides, and negatives documenting Millett's activities and the people in her life. </p><p>Rounding out the visual components of the collection are over 250 pieces of Millett's artwork created by Millett, who was also involved in the Fluxus art movement. Predominant formats include ink drawings, calligraphy, and graphic prints. There are also sculptures and other three-dimensional works, some of which formed part of an installation representing events that surrounded the murder of Sylvia Likens, also the subject of Millett's book, <title render="italic">The Basement</title>. A full inventory of the artwork is available in this collection guide.</p><p>Electronic formats include some correspondence, book drafts, and other writings. These files are included in the inventory under the appropriate series. The electronic files have been  migrated to a library server; please contact the Rubenstein Library for access.</p>  </scopecontent>

For each book title, undated drafts and notes come first, followed by book reviews, fan mail, contracts, and material collected by Millett as background for the book. Book drafts are sometimes labeled by letter, as in "draft A" or "draft B." This does not imply that one was written before the other, but only gives an order to their presentation.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Other Writings</emph> subseries offers material related to Millett's articles and unpublished manuscripts.

primarily include records from Millett's political involvements as a feminist, a mental health reformer, and a social activist; information that Millett collected for her writings and other projects; and personal papers related to travel, funding for the farm, and other issues. The early women's rights movement, from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s, is strongly represented. Various self-advocacy organizations within the psychiatric survivors movement, primarily from the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s, are also well-represented. </p><p>The series includes the following subseries: Prisons, Psychiatric Survivors Movement, Torture, Travel, Women's Archives Project, and Women's Rights Movement. Within each subseries, files are organized in alphabetical order. A sequence of general subject files are placed at the end of the other subseries, in alphabetical order. Millett's own folder titles have been retained where possible.</p><p>Included in this series are some documents in electronic format. These are listed alongside correponding physical folders in the collection from which diskettes were separated, or containing closely related documents. If there is no corresponding folder, the electronic files are marked "electronic format only." For each electronic document, the container list provides the file name, the date the file was last modified, and the number assigned to the original computer disk on which the file was received.</p></scopecontent><accessrestrict id="aspace_cc6fa8ef943831dd83a7f479d8e22209"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Electronic records have been migrated to a library server.

Included also are some materials on other artists' work. Millett's activities as a member of the cooperative Noho Gallery are documented, and there are some materials from her involvement in the Fluxus movement. There are detailed records of Millett's direct sales of posters and silk screens, including fan letters from individuals who saw Millett's posters advertised in <title type="simple" render="italic">Ms.</title> magazine and other women's media outlets. Files in this series have not been arranged.</p><p> The series includes some documents in electronic format. Electronic documents are grouped with folders containing related paper documents. If there is no corresponding folder, the documents are marked "electronic format only." For each document, the container list provides the file name, the date the file was last modified, and the number assigned to the original computer disk on which the file was received. Consult a reference archivist for access to electronic documents.</p><p> See the Subject Files for additional material on other artists' shows and on Millett's poster sales. </p></scopecontent><c02

New York, founded and operated by Kate Millett. The series is divided into correspondence and administrative files. The correspondence consists chiefly of letters from friends and former students of Millett, and applications for residency. It is arranged chronologically, with application materials, including writing samples and artwork from prospective residents, placed at the end of the Correspondence Subseries. Administrative files are arranged chronologically at the end of the series. The administrative files consist of business records, plus a wide variety of other material related to the operation of the farm. This includes correspondence with past residents who volunteered to help with farmwork, publicity material on the farm and its Christmas tree sales, and Millett's personal account of the difficulties of running the farm in the early 1990s. Additional material on efforts to raise funds in the early 1990s can be found in the Women's Archives Project Subseries of the Subject Files.</p><p> The series includes some documents in electronic format. Electronic documents are grouped with folders containing related paper documents. If there is no corresponding folder, the documents are marked "electronic format only." For each document, the container list provides the file name, the date the file was last modified, and the number assigned to the original computer disk on which the file was received. Consult a reference archivist for access to electronic documents.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref1613_g7l" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate

professor. The series also contains Millett's student papers, papers written by her own students, and correspondence and other material related to her university activities. Millett's undergraduate work at the University of Minnesota and Oxford University is well represented, and some material is available from Millett's graduate work at Columbia University. Teaching materials are primarily from Millett's work at Barnard College and California State University at Sacramento. </p><p> The series is divided into two subseries for Millett's student work and teaching materials, and is in chronological order within each subseries. However, it is sometimes unclear whether notes from the 1960s represent student or teaching work, since Millett both taught and completed her graduate work during this period.</p><p> The series includes some documents in electronic format. Electronic documents are grouped with folders containing related paper documents. If there is no corresponding folder, the documents are marked "electronic format only." For each document, the container list provides the file name, the date the file was last modified, and the number assigned to the original computer disk on which the file was received. Consult a reference archivist for access to electronic documents.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref1778_hx9" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Student Work</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation"

Records are arranged chronologically within each subseries. </p><p> The series includes some documents in electronic format. Electronic documents are grouped with folders containing related paper documents. If there is no corresponding folder, the documents are marked "electronic format only."

expulsion from Iran, Iranian feminism, and the Iranian political situation during that period. A wide spectrum of American, French, and (to a lesser extent) Persian-language media is included. A second focus of the series is media coverage of Millett's activities and projects, especially for the 1970s. Other clippings are related to Millett's wide-ranging personal and professional interests, particularly prison reform and the status of women's rights around the world. A small amount of correspondence and other material is intermixed with the clippings. There are also a number of full issues of activist publications and newsletters.</p><p>In most cases, files in this series are arranged in original order, and have been left undated unless Millett's original folder title included a date range. There are few clippings from the 1980s. The series is in alphabetical order. Iran clippings are placed last, and are unorganized. Substantial numbers of clippings can be also found in the Subject Files and the Writings and Speeches Series.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref2205_e5f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Art

VHS tapes contain interviews and lectures given by Millett. There are two series of recordings on open reel videotape, both dating from the mid to late 1970s. The first series shows a 1976 reading at the Woman's Salon, a feminist literary salon in New York City. Millett and other writers speak about Anaïs Nin and read Nin's works. The second group of open reel recordings were made by Alida Walsh and Janey Washburn as a gift for Millett. They show the opening reception of a Millett art show, most likely at the Chuck Levitan Gallery in New York City. The recordings are unedited, with random crowd scenes mixed with informal interviews with guests. Cynthia MacAdams is mentioned as the model for the artwork, and makes frequent appearances in the recordings.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref4120_t78" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kate Millett

Formats include prints, slides, and negatives. There are portraits of Millett from a variety of sources. The professional photographers among Millett's acquaintance, including Cynthia MacAdams and Jill Krementz, took a number of photographs of Millett. Photographs most likely taken by Millett include a large number of slides dating from 1980, documenting the same time period as many of the audiotapes in the Audiovisual Materials Series. There are a limited number of snapshots from Millett's childhood and early adulthood. </p><p> Some photographs have been removed from correspondence located in other series. In these cases, the original series is identified and as much information as is available is given about the matching correspondence. The series is in chronological order. Oversize photographs can be found in Oversize Materials. </p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref2651_g8l" level="file"><did><unittitle>1912-1994 and undated, Family photos and
