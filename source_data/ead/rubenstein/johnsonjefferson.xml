         <head>Biographical and Historical Note</head>
         <p>Originally from Garland, North Carolina, Jefferson D. Johnson, Jr., attended Garland
            High School and Trinity Park School in Durham before enrolling in Trinity College in
            1919. He served as a private in World War I before returning to college and graduating
            with a B.A. in 1923. Johnson was an active member of Trinity's Sigma Chi fraternity and
            also played semi-professional baseball. After teaching for a year, he returned to
            Trinity and earned a law degree in 1926. In 1935, he married Frances Faison. The couple
            eventually had three children. </p>
         <p>Johnson became the Town Attorney for Clinton, N.C., and served from 1928-1941. He also
            successfully ran for State Senator of the 9th District in 1937 and 1941. In 1941, he was
            appointed Special Superior Court Judge, where he served until 1945. He managed the
            successful U.S. Senate campaign of J. Melville Broughton in 1948, as well as the
            unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign of Franklin P. Graham in 1950. The 1950 campaign was
            extremely controversial, with Graham's opponent, Willis Smith, using racist language and
            personal attacks on Graham to gather the support of white voters afraid of
            desegregation. </p>
         <p>In that same year, 1950, Johnson was elected Associate Justice of the State Supreme
            Court. He served until forced to retire from illness in 1959. He died shortly afterward
            in 1960.</p>

         <p>The Campaign Recordings series consists of original audio recordings from the 1948 and

         <head>Collection Arrangement</head>
         <p>The collection is arranged into two batches that reflect the order of arrival of the
            materials. There is some content overlap between boxes 1-12 and boxes 14-16, so please
            check the boxlist thoroughly if you are searching for particular items or topics.</p>
         <p>The condition of many materials is quite poor, particularly the printed materials and
            manuscripts from the Senatorial campaign of 1950. Water damage from long ago has left
            stains and tears on the pages, and some are quite warped and delicate. Please use
            caution when handling this collection.</p>
