            Chatterley span the years 1983-2013, and were created throughout his career as a
            documentary photographer, beginning with his MFA thesis project on religious experience
            in the U.S. The photographs are primarily black-and-white prints ranging in size from
            8x10 to 18x24 inches. The most prominent themes in Chatterley's work are labor,
            community, and religious expression. He has photographed chicken slaughterhouse workers
            in Maine; Cambodian immigrants in North Carolina; David "Honeyboy" Edwards and other
            Southern blues musicians in Mississippi and on tour; a substance abusers' rehabilitation
            community in Durham, N.C.; tornado survivors in South Dakota; an abandoned religious
            theme park in Connecticut; and sheep rancher Judith Fae "Pachy" Burns in Montana. Some
            of his documentary work also includes oral history interviews. There are also several
            recordings of interviews with Chatterley, where he speaks about his work as a
            documentary photographer, and a book by Barbara Lau containing his photographs of
            Cambodian immigrants. Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke
            University. </abstract>

               <p>Consists of 50 8x10 inch selenium-toned gelatin silver prints and one larger
                  undated laminated color placemat. Built in 1958, Holy Land USA was a religious
                  roadside attraction in Waterbury, Connecticut. The images document the condition
                  of the park, which closed in 1984 after 26 years of operation. Original captions
                  taken from back of prints. Many of the images were printed in 2001. Prints are in
                  original order as received.</p>

               <p>Consists of three 11x14 inch and 40 18x24 inch gelatin silver prints for
                  Chatterley's Master of Fine Arts thesis at Southern Illinois University at
                  Carbondale, entitled <title render="doublequote" type="simple">Ambivalent
                     Ecstasies/Converging Energies.</title> This body of work explores religious
                  ecstatic experience. The three 11x14 prints offer a panoramic shot of the thesis
                  exhibit, while the forty 18x24 prints form the body of work for the thesis
                  project. The prints have no captions but are numbered sequentially, with
                  information included that indicates their positions in the exhibit, and the date
                  of the exhibit, May 6, 1987.</p>

               <p>Consists of 91 11x14 inch and 10 16x20 inch gelatin silver prints. On February 24,
                  1988, Penobscot Poultry in Belfast, Maine closed down. Chatterley documented the
                  final days of the last chicken processing plant in the state and followed former
                  employee Linda Lord as she sought new employment afterwards. The plant became the
                  subject of the book, <title render="italic" type="simple">I Was Content and Not

                  by Alicia J. Rouverol and Stephen A. Cole, with Chatterley contributing the
                  photographs. Original captions, with Chatterley's contextual side comments, were
                  taken from back of prints. Arranged chronologically.</p>

                  documenting Mississippi Delta blues guitarist David "Honeyboy" Edwards. Images
                  were taken between 1990 and 1996. They feature Edwards and the places he visited
                  while touring the southern and midwestern United States, including Arkansas,
                  Chicago, and Louisiana, and images of Honeyboy visiting friends, relatives, and
                  locations from his boyhood towns of Shaw and Greenwood, Mississippi. Some images
                  feature fellow blues musicians who appeared with Honeyboy in concerts and
                  recording sessions. Original captions with Chatterley's contextual side comments
                  were taken from back of prints. Arranged chronologically.</p>

               <p>This large body of work consists of images documenting the aftermath of a powerful
                  tornado that caused the nearly total destruction of Spencer, South Dakota (McCook
                  County) by a tornado on May 30, 1998, as well as the subsequent rebuilding of the
                  town, and the tenth anniversary of the tornado. The photographer, Cedric
                  Chatterly, is a resident of South Dakota. Original captions are taken from back of
                  prints. The 268 gelatin silver prints are arranged in original order as received,
                  with some gaps in numbering present.</p>

                     <p>This is one of the very first photographs I made when I arrived a half a
                        mile north of Spencer on May 31, 1998. People were gethering on the corner
                        of South Dakota Highway 38 and County Road 431. A state police barricade
                        would stop many people from entering, including residents. I entered easier
                        than most with my Press Pass. Governor Bill Janklow was there giving the "go
                        ahead" to anybody wanting to board the bus.</p>

                     <p>After having their home in Spencer destroyed by a F-4 tornado, they have
                        decided to rebuild their commercial property into a home 1/2 mile south of
                        town. This was once the Golden Pheasant Restaurant and Lounge. Legend has it
                        that an artist traveling through sometime in the 1950s painted the scenic
                        mural on the wall in exchange for several days stay in the adjoining motel.
                        I tried to talk Dave into letting the mural remain in what would become
                        their living room. Consideration was given but the mural fell to the Twedts'
                        hammers the following week. Over the month of July, the Twedts and I filled
                        several dumpster loads in the gutting process of this property.</p>

                        break from working on their home. Dave called these little rides into town
                        as "dress codes" or "inspecting the dress code" out of a tongue-in-cheek
                        poke at the recent building code enforcements that followed the tornado.
                        Dave was very vocal about the local politics.</p>

                     <p>5 days after a F-4 tornado destroyed 75% of the town organized volunteers
                        then cleaned recovered items and set them on tables in the McCook County
                        High School gym. The clothes that had been recovered were taken to the
                        Springfield State Prison near Yankton where they were laundered in 200 pound
                        capacity machines. Other items were cleaned and sorted by local
                        organizations. I saw several people, including Dave and Mary, pick up and
                        examine items that had been theirs prior to the tornado, then return them to
                        the table. Dave said, "Some things are better left alone..." Upon walking
                        into the gym for the first time, Nancy Webb said, "This is worse than the
                        tornado." Many folks stood over the tables that had been covered with
                        photographs from a period of at least 100 years and wept openly. It was the
                        most powerful photo exhibit I had ever witnessed.</p>

                     <p>The Twedts had been without running water for 45 days following the tornado.
                        The Twedts are now rebuilding commercial property into a home. The property
                        was once the Golden Pheasant Restaurant and Lounge with several hotel rooms.
                        Dave Twedt bought this property in 1986, several years before they bought
                        their home in Spencer about 1/2 mile to the north. The Twedts and I filled
                        the dumpster (right) more than 3 times with material during the "gutting"
                        process. The Twedts lived in the camper trailer for 6 months while working
                        on their home.</p>

                        Applicants must be 62 or older, or 18 with disability. The cost was $19,400,
                        including delivery. Five of these homes were purchased in 1998/99 by
                        families displaced by the tornado, three of which were placed in Spencer.
                        Although Kallie and her parents moved to Michigan, Delphia said later,

                        was stolen from his property on Christmas Eve, 1998.</p>

                        18 inch rope. Each player has a set of three, and they toss them one at a
                        time to one of two "gates" set about 20 feet apart. When a flopping string
                        of golf balls catches a rung and stays on or wraps itself around, points are
                        awarded: 3 points for the top, 2 for the middle, 1 for the bottom. The
                        player who gets 21 points first wins.</p>

                     <p>I had not seen Lloyd in nearly four years--about the time he and Nancy
                        divorced. When this image was made, he was living in Sheldon, Iowa, an hour
                        and a half from Sioux Falls and working in an ethanol plant. I once thought
                        of him as my closest friend in South Dakota... Many people thought the
                        tornado had hardly fazed Lloyd, and they were probably correct. But nobody
                        in his family called and asked how he was in the weeks that followed the
                        storm... This image was made the day Suzy Webb married her high school
                        boyfriend, Mike... Lloyd had not been out to the farm in nearly three years.
                        It was hard to know what he was thinking.</p>

                     <p>The home in the center of the photograph belongs to Cookie Mentle. Her son
                        Troy once owned the car in the driveway. Troy, Richard Stone, and another
                        boy were fishing during the day of the May 30, 1998 tornado. They were in
                        Troy's garage cleaning fish when Troy saw the tornado coming into town. He
                        managed to get himself, Richard and the other boy into a storm cellar just
                        seconds before the tornado passed over them. Richard Stone credits Troy for
                        saving his life. Troy died the following Halloween weekend from liver
                        failure due to excessive drinking. He was living an apartment in Sioux
                        Falls, South Dakota. I spoke to him on the phone just a few days before. His
                        name is present on the tornado memorial in town along with the six others
                        who passed on May 30, 1998. The Stones' house is in the distance to the

               <p>Founded in 1994, the Durham, North Carolina based Triangle Residential Options for
                  Substance Abusers (TROSA) is a multi-year residential program that enables
                  substance abusers to be productive, recovering individuals by providing
                  comprehensive treatment, work-based vocational training, education, and continuing
                  care. Chatterley's photographs document the program and its residents in the
                  spring and summer of 2002. Consists of one 11x14 print, two 6x20 prints, and
                  eleven 16x20 prints, all selenium-toned gelatin silver prints. Captions were
                  created by the photographer; prints are in original order as received.</p>

               <p>Series explores the intense work of sheep ranching during lambing season, with
                  photographs taken by Chatterley near Greenough, Montana, United States, in the
                  spring seasons of 2004 and 2005. The series focuses on rancher Judith Faye "Pachy"
                  Burns, who ran the operation with the help of friends, daughters, shearers, and a
                  migrant worker family from PerÃº. The photographer's own niece was also helping
                  out at the time the series was shot. Pachy Burns passed away some years later.
                  After her death, Chatterley visited her daughters, Bluesette Campbell and Piney
                  Hardiman, and their father, in Red Lodge and Scotch Coulee, Montana, in 2013;
                  there he took six more photographs, and recorded oral histories concerning Pachy
                  Burns, her family, and her life as a rancher. </p>
               <p>All of the 97 black-and-white selenium-toned prints measure 16x20 inches. Captions
                  were created by the photographer.</p>
