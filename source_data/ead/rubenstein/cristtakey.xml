        personal and professional correspondence and subject files (1960s-early 1970s) documenting
        Crist's medical training, internship, residency, and then his position as Assistant
        Professor at UNC Chapel Hill, especially his involvement in increased access to therapeutic
        abortions and health services; the development of abortion techniques; and sex and
        contraceptive education on and off campus. Also includes writings and speeches; patient
        notes (redacted); grant, research, and conference files; and printed materials, including

          <p>Addition (13,125 items, 21.0 linear feet) contains subject files that chronicle the
            history of the Crist Clinic from the opening of the clinic in 1973 to the early 21st
            century. The majority of the files contain Takey Crist's clippings on medical topics and
            issues relating to sex education and women's health care. Many files also refer to
            issues of significance for physicians running a private clinic.</p>
