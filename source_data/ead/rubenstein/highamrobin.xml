         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Robin Higham, Ph.D., was born in 1925, the son of an American mother and a British
            father. He raised in London before being sent to the United States at the outbreak of
            the Battle of Britain in 1940. He joined the Royal Air Force in 1943, and flew over both
            Europe and Asia before being discharged in 1947. He attended the University of New
            Hampshire and then transferred to Harvard University, graduating with honors in
            1950.</p>
         <p>Higham was also married in 1950 to his wife, Barbara, and the couple lived in California
            for a few years before returning to Cambridge. He earned his Ph.D. in 1957, with a
            dissertation on the development of British aviation. The family then moved to North
            Carolina, where Higham taught in the History Department at the University of North
            Carolina from 1957-1963. He also helped found the Duke and University of North Carolina
            National Security Seminar.</p>
         <p>Higham left UNC in 1963 and moved to Kansas State University, where he helped establish
            the school's doctoral program in military history. He also served as editor for <title
               type="simple" render="italic">Military Affairs</title> (now the <title type="simple"
               render="italic">Journal of Military History</title>) from 1968 through 1988, <title
               type="simple" render="italic">Aerospace Historian</title> from 1970 through 1988, and
            the <title type="simple" render="italic">Journal of the West</title> from 1977 through
            2003(?). In addition, he founded Sunflower University Press in 1977. He is professor
            emeritus in the History Department at Kansas State University.</p>
