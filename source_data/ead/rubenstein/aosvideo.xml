            show of still images chiefly taken at annual meetings of the American Ophthalmological
            Society, most of which were and still are held at The Homestead Resort in Hot Springs,
            Virginia. Though the series begins with historical images, the first of which is a
            panoramic print of the 1919 conference attendees, most date from the 1950s through 1993,
            and are mostly in color. Subjects typically include scenes from the meetings, candid
            portraits of individuals attending the meeting and enjoying recreational activities, and
            the locations and grounds where the meetings were held. A credit line bears the name M.
            N. Luxenberg, Malcom (Mike) N. Luxenberg, ophthalmologist in Augusta, Georgia, Past
            President of AOS, and Professor and Chair for Ophthalmology for Augusta University.
