      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>William Woods Holden (1818-1892) was a journalist and Republican governor of North Carolina
        from Raleigh (Wake Co.) N.C.. He was owner and editor of the North Carolina Standard
        newspaper from 1843 to 1860, during which time he was a member of the Democratic Party. He
        served as a N.C. delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Charleston, S.C., in
        1860. As the Civil War progressed, Holden criticized the Confederate government and became a
        leader of the North Carolina peace movement. In May 1865 President Andrew Johnson appointed
        him provisional governor of North Carolina, serving until December 1865. In 1868 he ran and
        won as the Republican candidate for governor. In an effort to combat the Ku Klux Klan,
        Holden suspended habeas corpus and imposed martial law on Alamance and Caswell counties. He
        was impeached in 1870 by the Democratic state legislature on eight charges related to the
        rough treatment of North Carolina citizens due to his efforts to combat the Ku Klux Klan. He
        was convicted of six of the eight charges and removed from office in 1871. Following his
        removal from office, Holden moved to Washington, D.C. and resumed a career in journalism. In
        1873, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him postmaster, a position he held in Raleigh
        until 1881.</p>
      <p>Holden was married twice: first to Ann Augusta Young, who died in 1852 and with whom he had
        four children. He married Louisa Virginia Harrison, a widow with four children of her own,
        in 1854. He died in Raleigh in 1892. </p>
      <p>Holden was sued by a rival newspaperman, Josiah Turner, in 1885, following Turner's arrest
        by Holden during his term as governor. The suit continued into the 1890s, despite Holden's
        being incapacitated by poor health. His wife, Louisa Virginia Holden, acted in his place and
        the suit was continued against her after Holden's death in 1892. Turner lost the suit in
        1894.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p> The collection documents Holden's career as a journalist and politician, including his
        shift in party allegiance from Democrat to Republican during the Civil War. He served as the
        28th and 30th governor of North Carolina. </p>
      <p>Pre-Civil War letters deal mainly with personal and legal matters and with the Democratic
        convention in Charleston, S.C., 1860, and presidential election of 1860. Post-war materials
        concern the history of journalism in North Carolina; Holden's appointment by Andrew Johnson
        as provisional governor of North Carolina in 1865; his election as governor in 1868;
        Reconstruction policies; Ku Klux Klan activity in the state; the Kirk-Holden War; the
        "Ferrell Matter," a debt case in which Holden was the guarantor; Holden's impeachment as
        governor in 1870; his conviction by the N.C. Senate in 1871; his appointment as postmaster
        by Ulysses S. Grant in 1873; and life and politics in Washington during the period of
        Radical control. Of note are depositions and other evidence gathered by Holden and his
        supporters of various members of the Ku Klux Klan, documenting their membership and
        activities during 1869-1870. </p>
      <p>The collection also includes Holden family papers, including scrapbooks and account books
        kept by Holden's wife and daughters; Holden's memoirs, recorded by his daughter Mary Holden
        Sherwood and edited by W.K. Boyd as part of the Trinity College Historical Society; some
        family photographs and materials related to the Holden homestead in Raleigh, N.C.; writings
        and poetry by Holden and his son, Joseph Holden; obituaries and clippings about Holden and
        his legacy; and other assorted personal and financial papers. Though removed from public
        life, Holden continued to write about public policy and government, sometimes critical of
        both parties, until his death in 1892. </p>
