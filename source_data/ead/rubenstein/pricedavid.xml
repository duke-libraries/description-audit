      <abstract id="aspace_6f6627108a86b73204e33d12fede833c">David Price is a political science
        professor at Duke University, and Democratic congressman from North Carolina's Fourth
        District since 1987 (re-elected in 2006). The David Price Papers (1960-2006) document the
        scholarly and political career of David Eugene Price, including his days as a graduate
        student in the 1960s, his tenure as a political science professor and Democratic Party staff
        member, and, finally, his years as a Democratic congressman from North Carolina's Fourth
        District. Records from Price's political headquarters contain thousands of original
        documents, handwritten and computer-generated; printed materials such as legislative bills
        and campaign publicity; and a variety of audiovisual materials, including photographs, some
        slides, many videos, and audio recordings. The collection is especially rich for researchers
        interested in the American political party system, the work and life of legislators, North
        Carolina history and government, the North Carolina Democratic and Republican parties, the
        U.S. Congress, its committee structure, the Hunt Commission, and the broader legislative
        process. Other materials document political campaigns, notably David Price's own
        congressional campaigns and Albert Gore's senatorial campaign of 1970-1971.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">David Price Papers</emph> document the scholarly and political
        career of David Eugene Price, including his days as a graduate student in the 1960s, his
        tenure as a political science professor and Democratic Party staff member, and, finally, his
        years as a Democratic congressman from North Carolina's Fourth District from 1987 through
        1998. Records from Price's political headquarters record the routine activities of Price and
        his office staff, and the larger system of government in which he participated. The files
        contain documents, handwritten and computer-generated; printed materials such as legislative
        bills and campaign publicity; and a variety of audiovisual materials, including photographs,
        some slides, many videos, and audio recordings. The collection is especially rich for
        researchers interested in the American political party system, the work and life of
        legislators, North Carolina history and government, the North Carolina Democratic and
        Republican Parties, the U.S. Congress, its committee structure, the Hunt Commission, and
        especially the larger legislative process. Other topics include political campaigns, notably
        Price's own campaigns and Albert Gore's senatorial campaign of 1970-1971.</p>
      <p>Three primary groups comprise the collection. Full descriptions of series and subseries
        within these groups are found below in the detailed collection description. The <emph
          render="bold">Pre-Congressional Papers</emph> primarily document Price's years as a
        student, then as a professor at Yale and Duke Universities; they also trace Price's early
        involvement with the Democratic Party. These papers are a foundation and prelude to Price's
        later work as a member of Congress. The <emph render="bold">Congressional Papers</emph> were
        compiled during his years in public office, and reveal Price's activities as a member of
        Congress, and his relationships with colleagues, constituents, and other political
        stakeholders. Finally, the <emph render="bold">Campaign Office Files</emph> were created
        from the activity of his campaign office in Raleigh, North Carolina, largely separate - as
        required by law - from the work of his congressional office. </p>

      <head>Processing Note</head>
      <p>Most original folders and folder titles have been retained. Labels included many
        abbreviations, acronyms, and initials; the full versions were added in brackets whenever
        possible. "DP" in folder titles and elsewhere usually refers to "David Price" but can also
        mean "Democratic Party." Keyword searching is possible within the container list, with some
        important limitations. First, the expanded forms of acronyms and abbreviations were not
        added in every instance but rather at the first occurrence with a new series or subseries.
        Second, labels are not standardized. For example, the search "breast cancer" might retrieve
        some folders, but not the one labeled "Cancer--breast." A search for the EPA's "Southern
        Appalachian Mountains Air Quality Initiative" within this collection may not retrieve
        folders labeled only as "Southern Appalachian Air Quality." To be comprehensive, therefore,
        searches need to be formulated in several ways. Please consult with a Research Services
        staff when using this collection.</p>
      <p>Dates were obtained by sampling within folders and so may not be strictly accurate.
        Sampling was also used to identify the content of audiovisual materials, therefore
        descriptions for recordings may not be complete.</p>

          <p>These files document the bulk of David Price's academic career prior to his entry into
            elective office, and reveal the formation of Price's intellectual interest in politics
            and political parties. Beginning in the mid-1960s during his time as a graduate student
            at Yale University, they continue through his years on the faculties of Yale and Duke,
            and end in 1988 during his first term in Congress. The materials are divided into three
            series, all described further below: Political Party Files; Correspondence and
            Administrative Files; and Research and Writings. Within each series, the folders are
            arranged in alphabetical order by title.</p>

            <p>Documents Price's close observance of, employment with, and research on the
              Republican and Democratic political parties, from his graduate work at Yale up to the
              time he was first elected to Congress. During much of this period Price was serving as
              a professor of political science at Yale and Duke Universities. Concurrently he also
              worked for the North Carolina State Democratic Party in various capacities, serving as
              executive director and as state party chair, and for the national party as director of
              the Hunt Commission (Commission on Presidential Nominations). The files illustrate the
              inter-relationship of Price's political work and research. Many of the topical folders
              contain Price's notes, often related to his writings, as well as articles and
              documents written by others. Background files for his book on American political
              parties, <title type="simple" render="italic">Bringing Back the Parties</title>, can
              be found in this series. As in other parts of the collection, Price's relationships
              with other prominent political figures are documented here, especially with Jim Hunt,
              North Carolina governor and head of the Hunt Commission. Correspondence, Hunt
              Commission documents and meeting transcripts, and a file on Jim Hunt's Senate race
              against Jesse Helms are included. Other files relate to talks Price gave as a state
              party leader and include the speeches themselves or Price's notes. There are also
              files on conferences attended, polling information, and numerous files on Democratic
              campaigns such as Hunt-Helms (U.S. Senate, 1984), Muskie (U.S. Presidency, 1972),
              Carter (U.S. Presidency, 1980), and Albert Gore, Sr. (U.S. Senate, 1970). </p>
            <p>The files are arranged roughly in alphabetical order by title. </p>
            <p>See also the Research and Writings Series for further documentation of Price's
              research interests.</p>

            <p>Documents various aspects of Price's political and academic careers. Political files
              illuminate Price's ties to other prominent Democrats and his work on the Democratic
              Party's behalf, chiefly through correspondence, while academic files concern Price's
              academic administrative responsibilities, chiefly at Duke University and less often at
              Yale University; some materials pertain to personal activities such as Price's leave
              of absence, including fellowship applications, course syllabi, and course evaluations.
              Other items, such as departmental newsletters and other materials, give a larger
              picture of Price's academic environment. One file relates to the controversy over
              whether Duke should host the Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library. While
              correspondence is scattered throughout the Pre-Congressional Papers, this series
              contains several folders devoted almost entirely to correspondence. These letters to
              and from Price cover both personal and political topics, with the latter most often
              about fundraising.</p>
            <p>The series is roughly arranged alphabetically by topic.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>These materials, dating from the time of Price's dissertation research up to his
              first election in 1987, document his career-long interest and extensive scholarship in
              politics and the legislative process. While similar to the Political Party Files in
              that both contain research, these files focus less on Price's work for the Democratic
              Party or his academic work on the subject of political parties. Topics instead relate
              more to his scholarship in other areas of government and legislative policy. </p>
            <p>While there is no draft of Price's dissertation within the collection, a number of
              files pertain to that research, including notes from many Senate interviews. Often the
              folders are topically centered on various congressional committees or particular
              policy areas (e.g. oceanography). Articles by others accompanied by Price's notes and
              pertinent correspondence may be found in this subseries also. As in previous
              subseries, correspondence is scattered throughout. These are the types of files
              presumably created as research files to assist Price in his own writing. In fact,
              there are more research materials than there are actual writings by Price himself.
              Document types include numerous handwritten notes, some article drafts, writings by
              others, and printed materials such as clippings, and parts of the <title type="simple"

              <p>Files are arranged according to original topical divisions and contain a variety of
                documents including correspondence, printed materials, meeting documents, memos,
                articles, trip itineraries, and handwritten notes. </p>
              <p>Academic and political entities mentioned frequently include the following: the
                American Political Science Association (APSA); the Democratic Caucus; the caucus
                Committee on Organization, Study, and Review (OSR); the Democratic Leadership
                Council (DLC); the House Appropriations Committee; the German Study Group (a
                congressional organization Price chaired); the Brookings Institute; the German
                Marshall Fund; and the North Atlantic Assembly. Also notable are files on Democratic
                conventions as well as House member Jim Wright. Finally, in addition to the files on
                specific topics and organizations, more general working files include travel files
                that document his many appointments to U.S. delegations, and correspondence with
                academic contacts, other House members, Senators, and the White House.</p>
              <p>Files are arranged alphabetically by topic; within these topics, folders are
                unarranged.</p>

                <p>Documents the trips abroad Price took as a Congressional delegate, often meeting
                  with foreign government officials. A file often provides information on a
                  particular country as it was viewed at the time through correspondence and
                  preparatory materials. Several trips were related to Price's chairmanship of the
                  House German Study Group. Other prominent organizations represented in this set of
                  files include the Conference of American and British Parliamentarians, the U.S.
                  Association of Former Members of Congress, the German Marshall Fund, and the North

              <p>Correspondence sent to and from Congressman Price documenting interactions with
                constituents; corporations and other organizations; government colleagues,
                especially other House Members; government agencies; national associations and
                organizations; and various notable political figures including U.S. presidents and
                foreign dignitaries. Notable correspondents include many House Members and Senators
                including Speaker Jim Wright, Terry Sanford, and other officials including President
                Bill Clinton, and Vice President Al Gore. Though some of the letters are routine
                congratulations or requests, others document in great detail his legislative
                relationships, activities, and appearances, and shed light on political issues
                important to Price and his constituency at any given time. It is likely that some of
                the outgoing letters were written by Price's staff.</p>
              <p>Topics range range widely depending on the issues of the time. Letters devoted to
                topics of particular interest to North Carolina such as National Science Foundation
                funding for Wake Technical Community College, drilling off the North Carolina coast,
                an air route to London from Raleigh, N.C., and funding of Environmental Protection
                Agency construction in Price's district. Other topics mentioned repeatedly include
                the national budget and budget votes, reproductive rights, affordable housing, the
                Americans with Disabilities Act, the 1988 Civil Rights Restoration Act, crime bills,
                the Title X Gag Rule, the Persian Gulf War, gun control especially regarding assault
                weapons and the Brady Bill, the environment, energy policy, surface transportation,
                appropriations bills, the Super Collider project, the Freedom of Choice Act, the
                Student Loan Affordability Act, health care reform, the Scientific and Technical
                Education Act of 1992, and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).</p>
              <p>Constituent letters were often copied and attached to letters sent to Price's
                colleagues, government agencies, or VIPs. Similarly, much of the mail in this series
                could be described as issue mail since issues are discussed throughout, but Price
                also maintained a separate file with this designation.</p>
              <p>See also correspondence in the <emph render="bold">Member Files</emph> subseries of
                the <emph render="bold">Personal/Political Files.</emph> There is also
                correspondence throughout the <emph render="bold">Pre-Congressional Papers,</emph>
                some in the <emph render="bold">Campaign Files</emph> of the <emph render="bold"
                  >Personal/Political Files,</emph> and spread throughout the entire collection.</p>
              <p>Correspondence files are arranged by year, and then by type of correspondent. </p>

                <p>Contains a variety of documents but predominately is made up of recommendations
                  by Price sent to various colleagues and branches of government. Often there is a
                  written request, a written acknowledgement of the recommendation, résumés, and
                  related documentation. Correspondents include White House official Bruce Lindsay
                  of the Clinton Administration. These recommendations are for a range of positions,
                  from placement in the freshman class at the University of North Carolina to
                  ambassadorships and other top-level White House positions. The letters are
                  arranged alphabetically by name of the person being recommended.</p>

            <p>Correspondence, clippings, published materials, office files, memos, Congressional
              Research Service documents, targeted mailings, newsletters from a variety of
              organizations, notes, committee testimony, and speeches, all documenting Price's
              participation in the introduction and movement of bills, his general legislative
              interests, impact, and influence, as well as the interaction of legislative concerns
              and interests with the pressures of his constituency. It is unclear whether this was a
              central file in Price's office, whether it belonged to Price or another staff member,
              or whether it was shared by several staffers who worked on legislative initiatives and
              policy decisions with Price. </p>
            <p>The most common correspondents are Price, other members of Congress, and Senators
              involved in the legislative initiative, especially those serving on a relevant
              committee. Letters from constituents and constituent organizations on particular
              issues are often found in these files, as are Price's responses. Another significant
              document type frequently found in these files is the briefing memo, sent between staff
              members of Price's office, which serve as direct evidence of how Price's staff worked
              together on issues, communicated their expertise to him, and developed policy
              positions and legislative initiatives.</p>
            <p>Most files are arranged in subseries according to House committee areas of
              jurisdiction. Within most subseries, the files are not arranged in any particular
              order. Committee and subcommittee structures and their names changed over time, and
              very often one committee's jurisdiction will overlap another's. Familiarity with
              committee jurisdictions of the late 1980s and 1990s will be helpful in searching these
              files. </p>

                <p>Relates to various agricultural projects or legislative initiatives requiring
                  funding. Correspondents include Appropriations committee members, especially
                  Richard J. Durbin, and officials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and North
                  Carolina State University. Letters very often ask for support for a particular
                  project. Topics mentioned include Appropriations Committee selection, and
                  agriculture-related projects especially in North Carolina. Projects range from FDA
                  drug approvals to the Bowman Gray Nutrition Center in Winston-Salem, N.C. There is
                  no clear difference between many of these files and the Agriculture files
                  immediately preceding the Appropriations Subseries.</p>

              <p>Prominent organizations represented include the House Budget Committee and the
                Congressional Budget Office. Topics include committee assignments, the testimony of
                Robert Reischauer, reconciliation conference, budget resolutions, and Clinton vs.
                Kasich budget plans. The primary document type is correspondence, but there are a
                number of fact sheets distributed by the Democratic Study Group. The files are

                mentioned frequently include the National School Boards Association; the Taft
                Institute; OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration]; the U.S. Department
                of Labor; and telecommunications organizations such as cable companies and the FCC
                [Federal Communications Commission]. Prominent labor and economic topics include:
                the Family Medical Leave Act; RICO [Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt
                Organizations] legislation; unemployment; child welfare issues; Head Start programs;
                hunger and welfare issues; and Wake County schools.</p>
              <p>Education topics reflect the concentration of higher institutions of learning in
                Price's constituency, his interest in this area of legislation, his time spent on
                the Science, Space, and Technology Committee as well as his time as co-chair of the
                Literacy Task Force of the Sunbelt Caucus. Subjects represented include: the Higher
                Education Act; all levels of education; student financial aid; literacy; Goals 2000:
                Educate America Act; national service legislation; standardized testing; technology
                issues; and telecommunications issues. Other topics present seem to relate to this
                committee area tangentially such as files on infant mortality. </p>
              <p> Document types and formats include correspondence, Congressional Research Service
                reports, various office documents, bills, staff memos, talking points, committee

              <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
              <p>Contains documents related to a variety of topics, chiefly energy production and
                the environment. Issues and legislative initiatives vary widely but often relate to
                the environment, including the following topics: clean air and wilderness; animal
                welfare; public health; cancer hospitals; the FDA [Food and Drug Administration];
                various medications; maternal-child programs; Medicare; insurance and other
                health-related issues; cable television; telecommunications; energy and utility
                issues; nuclear power legislation; and energy policies. There is less correspondence
                and a higher frequency of staff memos to Price, perhaps reflecting less activity in
                this area of legislation.</p>
              <p> Prominent organizations in these files include: the EPA [Environmental Protection
                Agency] or environment-related organizations such as the Environmental Defense Fund;
                certain North Carolina organizations; UNC [University of North Carolina]; the State
                of North Carolina; North Carolina State University; the FCC; telecommunications
                companies; public radio; and CPandL [Carolina Power and Light].</p>
              <p> As in previous subseries, correspondence frequently reveals evidence of
                legislators attempting to gain support for their initiative. The files are
                unarranged.</p>

              <p>Political efforts documented here often involved clean water legislation, ocean
                dumping by the Navy, other ocean spills, wetlands, clear cutting, and North Carolina
                forests. Prominent correspondents include congressional colleagues and stakeholders
                for the various issues involved such as the North Carolina Zoo, North Carolina state
                government officials, and the Committee on Natural Resources.This subseries also
                includes information on topics that may have previously been placed under the
                committee heading of Merchant Marine and Fisheries.</p>

              <p>North Carolina universities within Price's district, especially North Carolina
                State University and Duke University, are the most frequent correspondents. The
                National Weather Service is mentioned frequently as are the following topics: the
                space program; the superconducting supercollider program and its funding; and
                supercomputers. The committee with jurisdiction over Science and Technology issues
                was actually called Science, Space, and Technology during most of the life cycle of
                these files. Prior to Price's first term, the committee had been called simply <emph
                  render="doublequote">Science and Technology</emph> and appears often to have been
                referred to in that way. The abbreviations <emph render="doublequote">SandT</emph>
                and <emph render="doublequote">SSandT</emph> are seen throughout the files. Files
                are unarranged.</p>

              <p>Consists primarily of copies of correspondence, usually requesting Price to
                cosponsor commemorative legislation, and his positive responses. These letters
                discuss legislation designating certain calendar days as commemorative, designed to
                raise awareness for a particular medical condition or gain recognition for a cause
                or particular group or people (e.g. Emergency Services Week). There is frequently a
                note appended where Price (or a member of his staff) indicated his reason for
                cosponsoring and staff input. Correspondents are usually congressional colleagues
                with whom the legislation originated. In rough chronological order as received.</p>

              <p>Consists almost entirely of correspondence, usually sent between House Members, the
                Speaker of the House, or sometimes the President or an outside party. The letters
                relate to a variety of matters, political causes, legislative initiatives, all
                attempting to influence policy and legislation. All are letters for which multiple
                cosigners were sought, including Price. The file appears to be one of record for
                Price, although his signature was not confirmed on each letter. Arranged by Congress
                and sometimes further arranged by topic (House committee areas of jurisdiction).</p>

              <p>Appears to be a representative sampling of constituent letters with Price's
                responses, documenting the North Carolina constituency's interest in and opinions on
                a variety of issues and Price's manner in handling comments and requests. Some
                clippings and other enclosures are also included. Topics vary but include gays in
                the military, health care reform, reproductive rights, and funding for the
                Environmental Protection Agency. Files are arranged by year, then alphabetically by

              <p>Primarily contains clippings and speeches, but also includes material unrelated to
                public relations, such as occasional files on specific legislation and one focused
                on a staff retreat. Clippings center on specific issues or on Price himself, and
                sometimes parallel the Legislative Files in organization of topics, but are narrower
                in scope. Files may have been created by Price or by a member of his staff, "R.P."
                or "R.W." Arranged in rough alphabetical order.</p>

          <p>Series within this record group are devoted to particular campaigns, but there is
            overlap in content from one campaign to another due to recurrence of issues, themes, and
            constituencies. There is no series for the 1992 campaign, but some materials for that
            year appear in the <emph render="bold">Various Campaigns Subseries.</emph> Following the
            individual campaigns are several general subseries that cover multiple campaigns and
            center on such topics as precinct analysis, redistricting, and polling. Finally, the
              <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials Series</emph> documents Price's campaigns
            and other media appearances. Primary arrangement of series is chronological for the
            biennial campaigns from 1986-1996; within these series, original arrangement by topic is
            retained.</p>

            <p>Materials center on the 1992 campaign, although they are not restricted to it. The
              files are predominantly administrative, as previous subseries are, but include a
              larger number of financial records than other subseries have contained. Financial
              materials include bank account statements, check stubs, payroll records for campaign
              staff, and a variety of materials documenting campaign contributions. Original order
              has been retained.</p>

              Content varies but includes Price speaking in a variety of settings, documenting not
              only his use of television during campaigns and his congressional tenure, but also
              news coverage of his campaigns. There are many commercials from Price's campaigns and
              those of his opponents, including Vicky Rothrock Goudie, Bill Cobey, John Carrington,
              Tom Fetzer, and Fred Heineman. There are also a number of copies of Price's monthly
              television call-in show ( <title type="simple" render="italic">Keeping in
                Touch</title>), television news segments on Price and his campaigns, and other
              interview shows or segments. Formats in this series include videocassettes,
