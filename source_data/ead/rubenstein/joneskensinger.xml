            advertising agencies, including Leo Burnett Company, Campbell-Ewald Company, D.P.

            his second career as a professor of advertising at Michigan State University. Materials
            consist primarily of correspondence, memoranda, notes, reports, scripts, and audiovisual
            (including videocassettes) materials that document the development of print, radio, and
            television advertising campaigns for a wide variety of clients. The history and
            management of advertising companies in Chicago and Detroit, in Australia, and in
            Singapore is also represented. Major clients and campaigns documented include Chevrolet,
            the Florida Citrus Commission, General Motors Corporation, and Oldsmobile.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Kensinger Jones Papers, 1934-2001,</emph> document Jones's
            primary career as an executive for several major advertising agencies, including Leo
            Burnett Company, Campbell-Ewald Company, D.P. Brother and Company, Wilding Advertising,
            and William R.Biggs/Gilmore Associates; and his second career as a professor of
            advertising at Michigan State University. Materials consist primarily of correspondence,
            memoranda, notes, reports, scripts, and audiovisual materials that document the
            development of print, radio, and television advertising campaigns for a wide variety of
            clients. The history and management of advertising companies in Chicago and Detroit in
            the United States, in Australia, and in Singapore is also represented. Major clients
            documented include Chevrolet, the Florida Citrus Commission, General Motors Corporation,
            and Oldsmobile. </p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Advertising Agencies Series, </emph>the largest, includes
            memoranda and correspondence related to the executive management of each agency and
            Jones's role in organizing and directing the creative activities of the agency or
            advertising team. Materials from Jones's work at the Leo Burnett Company consist
            primarily of office memoranda and weekly progress reports for radio and television
            commercials for clients such as: Mars, Incorporated; Kellogg Company; and the Green
            Giant Company. In Southeast Asia, Jones served as Regional Creative Director for Leo
            Burnett offices in Sydney, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Bangkok. Materials
            include correspondence, speeches for creative seminars, and scripts for two films for
            the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board. Jones worked mainly with clients in the
            automotive industry, specifically Chevrolet at the Campbell-Ewald Company and Oldsmobile
            at D.P. Brother Company (as well as at Leo Burnett). Materials about General Motors
            relate to the potential of television specials for corporate advertising to promote the
            GM "Mark of Excellence" and the corporation's responsiveness to environmental and safety
            issues in the late sixties and seventies. Closely related to the Advertising Agencies
            Series, the <emph render="bold">Correspondence and Memoranda Series </emph>consists of
            carbons of outgoing correspondence from Jones, filed in chronological order with some
            memoranda.</p>
         <p>Nearly a third of the collection pertains to Jones's tenure from 1982-1995 as Lecturer
            in the Department of Advertising, the School of Communication Arts at Michigan State
            University. The <emph render="bold">Michigan State University (MSU) Series
            </emph>includes correspondence with colleagues and students, materials from academic
            conferences and MSU's Visiting Advertising Professional program, as well as copies of
               <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Impact,</title> the alumni newsletter for
            the Advertising Department. Of particular note are materials related to China and Taiwan
            in 1988 and 1990. The <emph render="bold">Course Materials Subseries </emph>details his
            advanced courses in creative advertising. In order to create a realistic, professional
            experience for the students, Jones assigned group projects that required students to
            create advertising campaigns or marketing strategies for national or state clients,
            local businesses, and university departments, including Archway Cookies, Oldsmobile,
            McDonalds, American Tourister, the Muskegon County Museum, and several MSU facilities
            and departments. The projects were presented to the class and evaluated not only by the
            client and Professor Jones, but also by the other students.</p>
         <p>Throughout his life, Jones considered himself primarily to be a writer, and the <emph
               render="bold">Writings and Speeches Series </emph>reflects Jones's lifelong writing
            efforts. The series includes a wide variety of professional, personal, and unpublished
            writing: advertising presentations, speeches, articles, advertising seminars, scripts
            for radio programs and plays, poetry, an unpublished novel, and an autobiography. The
               <emph render="bold">Speeches Subseries </emph>and <emph render="bold">Published
               Articles Subseries </emph>document his creativity in advertising and his
            contributions to the industry as well as to local schools and organizations. Material in
            the <emph render="bold">Personal Series</emph> demonstrates his activities with
            professional and civic organizations; in addition this series contains personal
            correspondence and materials about the life and career of Leo Burnett.</p>
         <p>Much of Jones's creative work in advertising was produced for the broadcast media,
            especially the early days of television advertising in the 1950s and 1960s. The <emph
               render="bold">Audiovisual Materials Series </emph>includes film and sound materials
            that document television advertising and Jones's creative contributions to the
            professional education of his advertising colleagues. Because several of his most
            successful films about advertising or creativity originated as speeches with slides,
            these materials are particularly rich in conjunction with related materials in the <emph
               render="bold">Writings and Speeches Series.</emph>

                  <p>Arranged alphabetically by major subject categories that correspond to Jones's
                     work as Creative Director and Executive Vice-President. Major accounts include
                     Chevrolet, General Motors, Florida Citrus Commission, and other new business
                     prospects. Many of the files pertain to the operation and reorganization of the
                     Creative Department as well as the management of the agency, when Jones served
                     on the Executive Committee. Several Chevrolet film commercials won awards at
                     notable advertising competitions. The papers also reflect Jones's focus on
                     professional development -- coordinating seminars within the agency, writing
                     articles, and presenting workshops with state, regional, and national
                     advertising organizations. One effort resulted in the <title type="simple"

                     resurgence of the Japanese economy after WWII. Both a filmstrip and a film
                     version were distributed by the American Association of Advertising Agencies
                     (AAAA) to high schools and colleges. See also the <emph render="bold"

                     consulting work and includes correspondence, memos, brochures, and scripts for

                     on advertising and marketing presented to car dealers, often at the annual
                     National Automotive Dealers Association meetings. Included are the transcripts
                     of interviews with several successful car dealers, which were used in the 1980
                     seminars. See also the <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials Series

                  <p>Arranged chronologically by academic quarter and by course, the <emph
                        render="bold">Course Materials Subseries</emph> pertains primarily to two
                     advanced courses: Advertising 417-"Advanced Creative Strategy and Execution"
                     and Advertising 441-"TV-Radio Advertising." For most courses, Jones taught over
                     fifty students, divided into two sections. Other courses include: Advertising
                     317-"Creative Strategy and Execution" and after 1989-1990, Advertising
                     492-"Advanced Copywriting." For each course, a "Course Materials" folder
                     typically includes a syllabus, a midterm and final exam, and for the later
                     years, a coursepak of readings. </p>
                  <p>Subsequent course folders pertain to student projects and are titled with the
                     name and location of the particular advertising client or product assigned for
                     the course. Materials typically include: 1) background information on the
                     client or product; 2) student reports often with creative illustrations and
                     sample advertising; 3) evaluations of the group presentations by the client, by
                     Jones, and by the other students; and 4) peer evaluations of individual
                     contributions to the group. During some courses, students produced video or
                     audio tapes. On occasion, selected student projects were presented at state or
                     regional competitions. (A folder at the beginning of this subseries contains
                     chronological and alphabetical listings of the student project
                     assignments.)</p>
