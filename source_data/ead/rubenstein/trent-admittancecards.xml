            University of Pennsylvania, Jefferson Medical College, Long Island College Hospital
            (Brooklyn, N.Y.), Harvard University Medical School, Philadelphia School of Anatomy, New
            Hampshire Medical Institution, Berkshire Medical Institution, and St. Bartholomew's
            Hospital (London, England). They contain the autographs of the most eminent professors
            of the day: i.e., Samuel Gross, Franklin Bache, Benjamin Rush, Austin Flint, Samuel
            Jackson, S. Weir Mitchell, J. K. Mitchell, Charles D. and James A Meigs, John Barclay
            Biddle, et al. The St. Bartholomew's Hospital card is signed by Ludford Harvey, John P.
            Vicent, and John Abernethy, the latter (1764-1831) being an eminent English surgeon and
            founder of the Medical School of St Bartholomew's. The "Order of Lecture" cards from
            Jefferson Medical College and the University of Pennsylvania list curricula, faculty and
            their residences, schedules of lectures and texts.Admittance cards, 1850-1853, are for
            courses at the Jefferson Medical School in Philadelphia. They include two matriculation
            cards for William D. Watson of Chatham County, N. C., dated Nov., 1850, and Oct., 1852,
            and an examination card Oct., 1852-1853, which is signed by Dr. S. Weir Mitchell as
            professor of Anatomy, Surgery and Physiology. Dr. Watson returned to Chatham County
            after his graduation. His house was destroyed during the Civil War. The portion of his
            medical library saved and stored in a neighboring attic eventually was placed in the
            historical Collection of the library of the University of Pennsylvania Medical
            School.</abstract>
