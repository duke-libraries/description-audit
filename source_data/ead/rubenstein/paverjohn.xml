      <p>Folder date spans were figured by sampling and so may not be strictly accurate for all
        materials in a particular folder.</p>
      <p>There was no meaningful arrangement to the collection when it came to the library, and so
        most organization has been imposed to approximate how Paver may have used the files. For
        instance, files obviously created during his tenure at the National Outdoor Advertising
        Bureau (NOAB) were pulled into a separate group of files by that name. Most individual
        folders hold a wide range of material types, such as manuscripts, photographs, and printed
        materials. Folder labels give an indication of most materials in a folder, but perhaps not
        all materials in the folder.</p>
      <p>All photographs, slides, and negatives were pulled from folders into their own series.
        Whenever a photograph had been filed with other papers, a photocopy was made of the
        photograph, and left with the papers to preserve context. Approximate dates on the backs of
        photos may not be accurate. They were usually entered into the image database when found,
        but could not be confirmed.</p>
      <p>Oversize materials were labeled with the same title as the folder from which they were
        pulled. Thus an oversize item may, for instance, have the title/label "Typescript" when the
        oversize item is actually a clipping, if "Typescript" is on the folder label from which the
        item originally came.</p>
      <p>Patrons should use caution since the collection still contains some rusty staples.</p>

      <p>After retirement, Paver still promoted the establishment of an international organization
        to make use of poster advertising throughout the world and traveled extensively for this
        purpose. He worked closely with the British and London Poster Associations and the Outdoor
        Advertising Federation of Europe. Paver also published "My World War II Experiences" at some
        point before 1968. Only a few copies were created by printer, Harry Deckoff, of the Tribune
        Printing Company in New York</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The John Paver Papers span the years 1920 through 1979, with the bulk of the collection
        dating from 1938 through the year 1971. The collection documents Paver's career in the
        outdoor advertising industry, especially his years as president of the National Outdoor
        Advertising Bureau (NOAB), and his work writing a textbook on the outdoor advertising
        medium. Series include the <title type="simple" render="bold">Biographical Files
          Series</title>; <title type="simple" render="bold">Writings and Speeches Series</title>;
          <title type="simple" render="bold">NOAB Files Series</title>; <title type="simple"
          render="bold">Subject Files Series</title>; <title type="simple" render="bold">Personal

          Series</title>; <title type="simple" render="bold">Photographs, Negatives, and Slides
          Series</title>; and <title type="simple" render="bold">Oversize Materials</title>.
        Researchers interested in the following subjects may find this collection especially
        helpful: management in the advertising industry, more specifically the outdoor advertising
        industry; the outdoor medium itself; and traffic and advertising. Common formats in the
        collection include paper files such as correspondence, meeting minutes, writings, memoranda,
        printed materials; and photographic prints and negatives. The <title type="simple"
          render="bold">Resource for Outdoor Advertising Descriptions (ROAD)</title> database, which
        holds searchable information about the images in this and other outdoor advertising
        collections will be available in early 2003.</p>
      <p> Paver was instrumental in the establishment of standards for traffic measurement and,
        later, standards and the quality of billboards, topics all reflected in each of the
        collection's series, especially the <title type="simple" render="bold">Writings and Speeches
          Series</title>, the <title type="simple" render="bold">NOAB Files Series</title>, and the
          <title type="simple" render="bold">Subject Files Series</title>. He pioneered research
        determining the relationship between traffic or habitual movement and trade activities. This
        work culminated in the publication, <title type="simple" render="italic">Traffic and
          Trade</title> (McGraw-Hill, 1935), co-authored with research associate Dr. Miller
        McClintock, and in the founding of the industry authority for measuring outdoor advertising
        circulation, the Traffic Audit Bureau (TAB). His contributions in the area of window display
        (show windows) advertising, and, more generally, the outdoor medium are significant as well;
        all are documented within the collection. A large part of his career was spent in service to
        the National Outdoor Advertising Bureau before and after World War II; he led the
        organization for about seventeen years and became a prominent figure in the outdoor
        advertising industry. The papers document well Paver's work on an outdoor advertising
        textbook through draft copies and research materials. Through this activity, Paver grew to
        become a respected authority on poster and painted display advertising in the United States,
        and served as a speaker and consultant in the last years of his life. For more detailed
        information about Paver's life and career, see the <title type="simple" render="bold"
          >Biographical Note</title> above as well as the <title type="simple" render="bold"
          >Biographical Files Series</title>. All collection series are further described within the
        container list.</p>

            memoranda, printed materials, and other non-manuscript items are presumed to relate to
            the drafts with which they are foldered--probably as research materials. The majority of
            the items in this series are draft pieces of Paver's planned textbook on the outdoor
            advertising medium, mostly in holograph (handwritten) or typescript formats, although
            the book was never published. Book segment titles were distinguished or subjects were
            assigned to folders wherever possible. The series is divided into two subseries,
            Writings and Speeches by Paver, and Writings and Speeches by Others. Paver's materials
            are further subdivided into three groups: (1) files created for his textbook, (2)
            speeches by Paver, and (3) miscellaneous writings by Paver. Writings and Speeches by
            Others contains far fewer items, but has similar groupings within it. Photographic
            materials from this series and all others have been removed to the <title type="simple"
              render="bold">Photographs, Negatives, and Slides Series.</title> Photocopies of most
            photographs were left in original order to preserve context.</p>

              <p>Paver's textbook files are evidence of his efforts to create a comprehensive
                introduction and analysis of the outdoor medium. Folders with title- or
                subject-identified materials make up the initial alphabetical run. These are most
                often typescripts with holograph edits, but there are some holograph manuscripts as
                well. Included are long descriptions of both subjects and organizations such as "the
                advertising agency," the Advertising Council, the National Outdoor Advertising
                Bureau, the Traffic Audit Bureau, the Outdoor Advertising Association of America,
                the American Association of Advertising Agencies, the Advertising Research
                Foundation, techniques of buying, art creation, writing advertising copy, market
                coverage, painted displays, public relations, and more general topics such as "
                Outdoor Advertising in the US."</p>

              <p>The next alphabetical run within Paver's textbook files contains items comparable
                to the alphabetical by subject group, but is ordered by genre/book part. It includes
                portions Paver labeled as the appendix, illustrations, and more. There are traffic
                flow graphs and a glossary of industry terms helpful for the novice advertiser. In
                addition, there are outlines, questionnaire results, and a large number of
                manuscript fragments. Similar to the previous group, these files describe outdoor
                advertising in detail, but also highlight its importance in the world with fragments
                such as one titled, "Posters as a Visual Aid in Projecting America's Image to the
                World." Paver compared the medium to others, wrote about industry changes and
                outdoor advertising abroad, and discussed industry research.</p>

              <p>Paver's speeches reveal his broad knowledge of the outdoor advertising industry; he
                spoke on the medium in general as well as on more specific topics like traffic
                measurement. This group of materials is evidence of his many speaking engagements in
                his home state of Texas, as well as abroad for the British Poster Advertising
                Association and the Outdoor Advertising Association of Australia. Paver also
                presented to organizations such as state outdoor advertising associations, and to
                smaller groups including a student women's advertising club. A number of the
                speeches were obviously connected to his work with the National Outdoor Advertising
                Bureau or were at least given during his employment there.</p>

          <p>The <title type="simple" render="bold">National Outdoor Advertising Bureau
              (NOAB)</title>, ca. 1919-1970, the organization with which Paver is most closely
            associated, was created to help advertisers obtain recognition by billboard owners and
            to handle arrangements for outdoor advertising. These files date from <unitdate
              normal="1925/1968" era="ce" calendar="gregorian" type="inclusive">1925 through
              1968</unitdate>. NOAB was a cooperative organization owned exclusively by the
            advertising agency members and helped them with all phases of an outdoor campaign. Paver
            assumed leadership of the agency in 1945, and by 1958 it placed over $70 million in
            contracts for painted displays, billboards, and other outdoor advertising. He directed
            the organization for about seventeen years, a time span reflected within the collection,
            but his time working for the NOAB Field Service Office in the late 1930s is also
            represented. The papers document his years of leadership through a variety of formats
            including minutes of NOAB's executive committee from 1950 through the time of his
            retirement. He represented NOAB through correspondence and multiple speaking
            engagements, serving often as a cheerleader promoting the industry. The series is
            arranged alphabetically by subject, revealing information about his travels abroad,
            contract and policy information, the industry's view of NOAB, Paver's specific duties,
            poster rates and evaluation, and work for Standard Oil. Particular attention is paid to
            the Traffic Audit Bureau (TAB) which Paver helped to establish and later defend. TAB
            became the industry's body to measure circulation of outdoor advertising and is still in
            existence. Included also are several manuals, some printed materials and other items
            about or related to NOAB. </p>

            but at the time of processing, resources were unavailable for item-level identification

            circulation, and engineering; biographical materials; TAB, OAAA, and NOAB; military
            orders and service during WWII; outdoor advertising construction, product name recall,

              >1950s.</unitdate> Some photographs show advertising artwork and artists at work on
            large painted displays, and some seem to form part of an office presentation. Other
            photograph subjects include office workers demonstrating particular activities; business
            gatherings of various sorts; advertising in Paris and an Asian city (perhaps in Japan),
            and a wedding gathering. Around 40 photographs show Paver's pool area, where he worked
            with and displayed his collection of orchids. </p>
