          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>The papers begin in 1736, when John Hall (ca. 1717-1790) and his brothers Henry and
            William become actively engaged in tobacco planting. The letters open with a land
            indenture of 1745 and continue as business correspondence with London, Annapolis,
            Baltimore, and local merchants and factories. Comment is made on salt as a necessity for
            plantation life in 1778 and 1782. An overseer's contract in 1764 gives details of
            plantation management and enslavement.</p>
          <p>A letter is signed by John Hall of "Vineyard" on June 11, 1778. As a member of the
            Maryland Assembly, he discusses the check and balance theory as it was working out in
            the "young government" of Maryland, he mentions violent contests, the quit rents and
            state revenue, militia service, and the role of the governor. In 1787 "Publicanus"
            addresses the people of Anne Arundel Co. on the topic of paper money.</p>
          <p>The will of John Hall (made in 1787) gives his estate as "Bachelor's Choice," on West
            River, and names his children and their families. Enslaved people are listed as part of
            the estate. Many of the later letters are from the families of Hall sibilings to William
            Henry Hall, son of John Hall. A series of law suits occurs in the 1790s as William Henry
            Hall settles his father's estate.</p>
          <p>A letter dated Oct. 3, 1796, to William Henry Hall describes the life of an American
            seaman impressed into the British navy. Samuel Hopkins, a young Maryland plantation
            overseer, and John Wilson of Cheraw, S. C., comment in letters to Hall from 1810-1813 on
            cotton planting in S. C. Hopkins describes on July 1, 1810, a plot by enslaved people to
            rise against enslavers in the Marlboro District of S. C. In 1813 he writes of hiring a
            substitute for himself if drafted in the War of 1812. Among W. H. Hall's correspondents
            were William, John, David, and John G. Weems of Anne Arundel Co., relatives of Mason
            Locke ("Parson") Weems.</p>

          <p>The bills and receipts contain many an "acct. sale" of tobacco, listing custom duties,
            charges, etc., in tobacco shipping. Estate inventories for Major Henry Hall, 1758, Thos.
            Lane, 1790-98, John Hall, 1795, and Mrs. Ruth Hall, 1803, include enslaved people and
            list possessions. Many mercantile and household accounts are included.</p>
          <p>There are 7 volumes dated 1765-1902. Six are account books, two that belonged to John
            Hall and 4 to William Henry Hall. There is one volume that belonged to Harriet Hall.</p>
