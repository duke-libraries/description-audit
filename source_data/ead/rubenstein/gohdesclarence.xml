        materials, correspondence, writings, clippings and other printed materials, and a few
        photographs, mainly from the latter half of Gohdes's career. The earliest date (1811) refers
        to reproductions of original research materials. Correspondence with other American
        Literature teachers and authors, combined with other materials relating to Gohdes's
        institutional and organizational affiliations, in particular with Duke University, the
        Modern Language Association (MLA), and the journal AMERICAN LITERATURE, comprise the most
        substantive aspects of this collection. They provide insight into American literary
        scholarship in the early and mid-twentieth century. Noted authors and scholars of the time
        whose letters and other writings are in the collection include Alexander Blackburn, Oscar
        Cargill, Lewis Chase, Robert Elias, Norman Foerster, Arthur Rubin, Arthur Quinn, and Upton
        Sinclair. Original manuscripts by Gohdes, inscribed reprints of writings by his colleagues,
        and materials relating to many major British and American literary figures, make up the rest
        of the collection. There is substantial material on Edgar Allen Poe and American humor. The
        collection also includes papers documenting Gohdes's research and writing for his last book
        project, a history of the muscadine grape in North Carolina entitled <title render="italic"
          >Scuppernong, North Carolina's Grape and Its Wines</title>. Acquired as part of the Jay B.

      <p>Clarence Louis Frank Gohdes began his post-undergraduate studies at Harvard, where he
        turned his attention from Latin to American literature under the tutelage of Bliss Perry, J.
        L. Lowes, G. L. Kittredge, and Kenneth B. Murdock. At Columbia, Gohdes wrote his
        dissertation under Ralph L. Rusk. </p>
      <p>Gohdes earned his scholarly reputation through his work in American literature. He
        published two texts, one on Ralph Waldo Emerson and the other on Walt Whitman, that
        contributed to American literary scholarship through his original research and archival
        work. Gohdes also influenced the formation of American literary studies through his
        long-standing position as Managing Editor (under Jay B. Hubbell, founding editor) and then
        Editor-in-Chief of <title type="simple" render="italic">American Literature</title>, the
        discipline's foundational academic journal. Similarly, Gohdes's <title type="simple"
          render="italic">A Bibliographical Guide to the Study of the Literature of the
          U.S.A.</title>, which went through five editions, played a key role in documenting and
        making accessible American literary criticism. Gohdes's career achievements attest to his
        role in extending the work of scholars of American literature.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Clarence Louis Frank Gohdes Papers date from 1811 to the 1990s, with the bulk of the
        collection dating from 1905 to 1981. Collection consists of research materials,
        correspondence, writings, clippings and other printed materials, and a few photographs,
        mainly from the latter half of Gohdes's career. The earliest date (1811) refers to
        reproductions of original materials used in his research. Correspondence with other American
        Literature teachers and authors, combined with other materials relating to Gohdes's
        institutional and organizational affiliations, in particular with Duke University, the
        Modern Language Association (MLA), and the journal AMERICAN LITERATURE, comprise the most
        substantive aspects of this collection. They provide insight into the bureaucratic and
        institutional exigencies of American literary scholarship in the early and mid-twentieth
        century. Noted authors and scholars of the time whose letters and other writings are in the
        collection include Alexander Blackburn, Oscar Cargill, Lewis Chase, Robert Elias, Norman
        Foerster, Arthur Rubin, Arthur Quinn, and Upton Sinclair. Original manuscripts by Gohdes,
        inscribed reprints of writings by his colleagues, and materials relating to many major
        British and American literary figures, make up the rest of the collection. There is
        substantial material on Edgar Allen Poe and American humor. The collection also includes
        papers documenting Gohdes's research and writing for his last book project, a history of the
        muscadine grape entitled <title type="simple" render="italic">Scuppernong, North Carolina's
          Grape and Its Wines</title>. </p>
      <p>The Gohdes Papers are divided into seven series: <emph render="bold">Biographical
          Data</emph>, <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph>, <emph render="bold">Author
          Files</emph>, <emph render="bold">Subject Files</emph>, <emph render="bold">Writings and
          Speeches</emph>, <title type="simple" render="italic"><emph render="bold"
            >Scuppernong</emph>
        </title>, and <emph render="bold">Clippings</emph>.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Biographical Data Series</emph> briefly sketches the major events
        of Gohdes's life. It consists of only a few items, including a one-page sketch by Gohdes of
        his career's highlights, and photocopies of Gohdes's obituaries. Further biographical
        information, especially pertaining to Gohdes's academic life, can be culled from materials
        in the <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph>.</p>
      <p> The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> contains letters exchanged with
        university administrators, publishers, colleagues, librarians, and literary figures. The
        series is divided into four subseries, <title type="simple" render="italic"><emph
            render="bold">American Literature</emph>
        </title>, <emph render="bold">Lewis Chase</emph>, <emph render="bold">Duke
        University</emph>, and <emph render="bold">General</emph>. The bulk of the correspondence
        concerns professional and academic affairs, such as appointments, editorships, research and
        reviews, and publishing. Included are exchanges between Gohdes and Duke University
        administrators about English Department and <title type="simple" render="italic">American
          Literature</title> affairs, as well as between Gohdes and contemporary literary critics
        about the study of American literature. There are also several documents that illuminate
        Gohdes's political affiliations and social concerns.</p>
      <p>Materials on approximately fifty authors, largely major British and American writers, are
        in the <emph render="bold">Author Files Series</emph> and were originally gathered by Gohdes
        and his colleague, Lewis Chase. The folders contain a variety of information on the
        represented authors, in an equally varied mix of formats: clippings, notes, lectures,
        student papers, photographs, and reproductions or photocopies of original writing.</p>
      <p>Included in the <emph render="bold">Subject Files Series </emph>are materials relating to
        several projects and interests which engaged Gohdes during his career. These include:
        bibliographies, poetry, travel narratives and the American West, and the United Nations'
        Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)/American Literature Section's
        Best American Books List. The bibliographies collected in this series reflect Gohdes's
        interest in this genre, as he participated in and edited many such projects throughout his
        career. </p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches Series</emph> contains manuscript and printed
        materials in two subseries: <emph render="bold">Writings by Gohdes</emph> and <emph
          render="bold">Writings by Others</emph>. The <emph render="bold">Writings by Gohdes
          Subseries</emph> includes manuscripts of short stories, poetry, and academic essays, as
        well as notes and notecards. The manuscripts also contain folders pertaining to unfinished
        projects and writings. The <emph render="bold">Writings by Gohdes Subseries</emph> also
        contains several folders of printed materials, consisting of reprints and reproductions of
        as well as advertising and promotional materials for Gohdes's published writings. This
        subseries consists almost entirely of reprints that are inscribed to Gohdes by the
        authors.</p>
      <p>Materials relating to the writing and research of Gohdes's last published book, <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Scuppernong, North Carolina's Grape and Its Wines</title>,
        are in the <emph render="bold"><title type="simple" render="italic">Scuppernong</title>
          Series</emph>. Three subseries make up this series: <emph render="bold"
          >Correspondence</emph>, <emph render="bold">Research and Notes</emph>, and <emph
          render="bold">Publication Materials</emph>. Correspondence plus photocopied articles and
        essays about the grape and agricultural production form the bulk of the series. Also
        included are Gohdes's many notes and notecards, as well as reviews and materials relating to
        the book's publication.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Clippings Series</emph> contains the few clippings that are not
        housed in the <emph render="bold">Author Files Series</emph>. These clippings mostly consist
        of articles relating to literary figures.</p>
      <p>Related collections in the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library include
        the records of <title type="simple" render="italic">American Literature</title> and the
        Modern Language Association's American Literature Section, as well as the papers of many of
        Gohdes's colleagues, such as Jay B. Hubbell and Arlin Turner.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Processing Note:</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Roman numerals and transcribed titles taken from the original folders have been appended to
        certain folders, such as the Contemporary Poetry Selections.</p>

          <p>Chiefly concerns professional and academic interests. The series is divided into four
            sections: <title type="simple" render="italic">American Literature</title>, Lewis Chase,
            Duke University, and General. </p>
          <p>The <title type="simple" render="italic">American Literature</title> correspondence
            mainly addresses administrative issues and editorial appointments. In particular, the
            letters represent discussions among Gohdes, Duke administrators, the <title
              type="simple" render="italic">American Literature</title> editorial board, and
            representatives of the American Literature Section (ALS) of the Modern Language
            Association over a 1966-1968 reworking of the contractual agreement between Duke and the
            ALS.</p>
          <p>The Lewis Chase correspondence contains letters exchanged between him and libraries and
            colleagues. All letters concern Chase's research on Edgar Allen Poe.</p>
          <p>Duke University Correspondence contains letters about Gohdes's discussions with the
            University and its English department over hiring, tenure, and his professorship.
            Included is a series of letters between Arlin Turner, Gohdes, and the administration
            that concerns a disagreement over the editorship of <title type="simple" render="italic"
              >American Literature</title>. The group also contains one letter from Lyne S. Few, son
            of William Preston Few, that recounts his memories of Duke faculty and his father's role
            at Duke. It was written in response to reading Gohdes's booklet, <title type="simple"
              render="italic">Pioneers in English at Trinity and Duke</title>.</p>
          <p>The General Correspondence includes letters from colleagues and peers, contemporary
            authors, and publishers and librarians. The main topics of discussion are professional,
            such as job appointments and recommendations, research and reviews, and publishing. The
            files include letters exchanged with some of the major scholars and authors of the day:
            Alexander Blackburn, Walter Blair, Van Wyck Brooks, Oscar Cargill, Robert Elias, Norman
            Foerster, Ima Honaker Herron, James Meriwether, Perry Miller, William Mulder, Arthur
            Quinn, Louis Rubin, Arthur M. Schlesinger (single item), Upton Sinclair, Henry Nash
            Smith, Robert Spiller, George R. Stewart, and George F. Whicher. Substantial
            correspondence exists between Gohdes and Thomas O. Mabbott, Henry A. Pochmann, and James
            Woodress. Other items of interest include a letter from Martha Baird (Mrs. Eli Siegel)
            to Gohdes which includes a copy of a letter from William Carlos Williams, letters
            exchanged with Clayton L. Eichelberger concerning the establishment of <title
              type="simple" render="italic">American Literary Realism</title> (journal), and
            invitations to Richard Nixon's 1971 and Ronald Reagan's 1985 inaugurations. Gohdes saved
            several form letters from major intellectual and political leaders: Albert Einstein;
            Archibald MacLeish; Richard M. Nixon; Pearl S. Buck; Jacques Cousteau; and Nancy Reagan
            (letter contains autograph). Arranged chronologically by date within each section.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>Consists of clippings, student papers, and notes. Some author files contain only
            printed materials or other non-original materials. Some, however, contain original
            notes, lectures, or early twentieth-century student papers. Lectures, usually by Lewis
            Chase, provide insight into turn-of-the-century literary perspectives on major authors
            from Poe to Shakespeare. The student papers suggest the scope and range of literary
            training and pedagogy at this moment in history.</p>
          <p>This series contains a large amount of material belonging to Dr. Lewis Chase
            (1873-1937). It seems that many unattributed items and folders came from Chase,
            including all student papers. The files which contain material compiled or created by
            Gohdes include those on Anderson, Dickinson, Dreiser, Eliot, Emerson, Faulkner,
            Fitzgerald, Frost, Garland, Holmes, Howells, James, Lanier, Longfellow, O'Neill, Ransom,
            Twain, and Updike. In particular, the Emerson "Notes" and Longfellow folders include
            substantial original materials by Gohdes. The rest of the folders seem to be heavily
            weighted to Chase materials, with only some of Gohdes's resources added. Most of the
            British authors are from Chase, whereas Gohdes is responsible for the American author
            materials.</p>
          <p>Several of the author files contain photocopies of selections or excerpts from the
            author's writing, for example, most of the Twain and all of the Sidgwick folders. "Mark
            Twain's Funniest" folders seem to have been one of Gohdes's projects.</p>
          <p>Within each folder, arranged alphabetically by author, items are arranged
            chronologically. Author names have been standardized on folder titles.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>Organized into groupings reflecting Gohdes's interests and projects: bibliographies,
            poetry, travel narratives of the American West, and UNESCO's best books list.</p>
          <p>The bibliographic materials contain issues of the <title type="simple" render="italic"
              >Bulletin of Bibliography</title> and bibliographic information that Gohdes requested,
            such as library holdings in literature in various areas, including Cleveland, St. Louis,
            and Balboa Heights (Canal Zone).</p>
          <p>The poetry files contain copies and mimeographs of late nineteenth- and early
            twentieth-century poetry. "Contemporary Poetry," "Modern Poetry" and "Poetry" all
            contain early twentieth century materials. The first folder, "Criticism and Reviews,"
            contains reprints of essays and articles by various authors. The only original writing
            can be found in the second folder, "Introductory Lecture, University of Wisconsin,"
            which Lewis Chase may have written. </p>
          <p>The "Travel Narratives and the West" folders contain photocopies and reproductions of
            nineteenth-century accounts of travel through the western United States, with some notes
            by Gohdes.</p>
          <p>Inspired by the UNESCO translation project, Gohdes initiated a survey of leading
            American literature critics and scholars in 1949 to determine the best twenty American
            books. Gohdes and his fellow committee members, Jay B. Hubbell and Lewis Leary,
            successfully polled approximately twenty-five people. Those polled include many major
            critics of the day: Ralph Rusk, Walter Blair, Henry Canby, Mark Van Doren, Fred Lewis
            Pattee, F. O. Matthiessen, Van Wyck Brooks, Clarence Gohdes, Jay B. Hubbell, Charles
            Anderson, and Henry Nash Smith. Files includes correspondence from these critics
            discussing and listing their choices for the best twenty American books. The survey
            seems to have been passed on to UNESCO, and was used for publicity for the American
            Literature Section of the Modern Language Association by submitting the final tallied
            poll to newspapers and journals. Arranged alphabetically.</p>

            <p>Consists chiefly of unpublished stories and memoirs as well as published writings.
              Also included are several academic pieces (other academic writing, such as lectures,
              can also be found in the Author Files Series). The manuscripts include work Gohdes did
              on an anthology, "True Stories about Indians from <title type="simple" render="italic"
                >St. Nicholas Magazine</title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">The Youth's
                Companion</title>." Materials related to this project include original introductory
              material written by Gohdes as well as marked-up pages from the two magazines
              indicating which stories he hoped to include.</p>
            <p>Notes and notecards pertain to Gohdes's more formal projects, while others provide
              insight into his many different interests. For example, a datebook contains "Some
              notes on big trees," which concern early literary references to large trees in the
              United States. Included is a notebook containing Gohdes's research on American humor.
              There are notes for a proposed project, "A Series on American Argument for Peace,"
              containing very rough bibliographic notes on possible entries.</p>
            <p>The Printed Materials consist of reprints of published articles by Gohdes, and
              include pamphlets and circulars that advertised the many series and books that Gohdes
              edited, introduced, or authored. </p>
            <p>Arranged alphabetically by title within each section.</p>

            <p>Chiefly contains articles and reprints that were sent and inscribed to Gohdes by his
              students and colleagues. The only manuscript materials are poems by Gohdes's one-time
              student, Kiffen Hayes. Several other pieces, not inscribed, comprise the rest of the
              subseries, including <title type="simple" render="italic">Norton's Literary Almanac

              of printed materials in the Gohdes Papers, created by a Duke University archivist,
              gives bibliographic information for many of the items. After the inventory, folders
              are arranged alphabetically by author.</p>

              Californian wine-grower, and on Garrett and Company, an American winery. The "Printed

              agriculture and science of grape production in the American South, many of which were
              published by government- or university-sponsored organizations. Also part of the
              subseries are several folders of notes, mainly on index cards, as well as folders on
              the two Garrett brothers (owners of a North Carolina winery), and Duplin Wine Cellars,
              another local vineyard.</p>
