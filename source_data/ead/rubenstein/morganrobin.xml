        essayist. She was a child model, had her own radio show at the age of four, and was a child
        star on television. Since the late 1960s, when she organized the first demonstration against
        the Miss America Pageant, Morgan has been active in the feminist movement. In 1984, she
        founded the Sisterhood is Global Institute, an international, non-governmental, and
        non-profit organization concerned with women's rights which is currently based in Montreal,
        Canada. </p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The collection documents the personal, political, and professional aspects of the life of
        an important feminist writer of the twentieth century. It is organized into the following
        series: <emph render="bold">Correspondence, Writings, Speeches and Interviews, Subject
          Files, Personal Files, Teaching Materials, Audio-Visual Materials, Photographic and Visual
          Materials, and Oversize Material. </emph>The largest group of materials consists of
        documentation on all of Morgan's significant written works: <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Demon Lover; </title><title type="simple" render="italic">Depth
          Perception; </title><title type="simple" render="italic">Dry Your Smile; </title><title
          type="simple" render="italic">Going Too Far; </title><title type="simple" render="italic"
          >A Hot January; </title><title type="simple" render="italic">Lady of the Beasts;
          </title><title type="simple" render="italic">Saturday's Child; </title>her well-known
        feminist anthologies, <title type="simple" render="italic">Sisterhood is Powerful
        </title>and <title type="simple" render="italic"> Sisterhood is Global</title>; and other
        materials on her poems, articles, and other writings. In addition, Morgan's papers hold many
        items of correspondence with a wide range of individuals, including prominent activists and
        feminists as well as family members and close friends. There is also a significant amount of
        correspondence and other material that documents Morgan's role as founder of the Sisterhood
        is Global Institute, and records related to her role as editor and writer for <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Ms.</title> magazine.</p>
      <p>Seen in a broader context, the collection provides ample documentation for the study of
        modern feminism. Morgan's subject files (the second largest in the series) are rich in
        materials related to the feminist movement in the United States and around the world; and
        materials concerning sexual health, witchcraft, lesbian feminism, and the social, economic,
        and political position of women in the world (especially in the Middle East, Russia, and
        South Africa). There are materials on individual figures such as Bella Abzug, Jane Alpert
        (imprisoned revolutionary), Patty Hearst, Gloria Steinem, and Marilyn Waring. Other series
        hold additional materials related to Morgan's career as a writer; several of her speeches
        and interviews; materials from Morgan's courses she gave on feminism; and photographs and
        audio-visual materials. </p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> spans much of Morgan's adult life. It
        is divided into two subseries: <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Name</emph> and <emph
          render="bold">Correspondence by Decade</emph>. The <emph render="bold">Correspondence by
          Name Subseries</emph> chiefly consists of Morgan's correspondence with family members,
        friends, fellow feminist activists and contemporary authors and critics. The bulk of the
        items in the <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Decade Subseries</emph> dates from the
        1990s and relates to the production of <title type="simple" render="italic">Ms.</title>
        magazine. <emph render="bold">The Correspondence Series is restricted</emph>: patrons must

      <p>The <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph> documents Morgan's career as a poet,
        novelist, essayist and journalist. Of Morgan's eighteen books, ten are represented in
        individual subseries. Particularly noteworthy is the material related to <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Sisterhood is Global,</title> which provides an inside view
        into the production of the anthology. The series also contains some of Morgan's earliest
        unpublished writings as well as files containing her comments on other writers' work, and
        single issues of periodicals in which she published her poetry. <emph render="bold">The
          Writings Series is also restricted</emph>: patrons must sign an Acknowledgment of Legal
        Responsibilities and Privacy Rights form before using the materials.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Speeches and Interviews Series</emph> primarily contains peripheral
        documentation such as contracts, correspondence, and schedules. However, there are drafts of
        a number of her speeches and interviews.</p>
      <p>Materials which Morgan collected over the years concerning American and international
        feminism are located in the <emph render="bold">Subject Files Series</emph>. The materials
        cover a number of topics, including women's economic, political, and social status, and
        feminist action - especially in South Africa, the Soviet Union, and the Middle East; rape,
        abortion, terrorism, female genital mutilation, and pornography; and the first feminist
        demonstration against the Miss America Pageant. Significant figures represented in the
        subject files include Marilyn Waring, Patricia Hearst, and Gloria Steinem. Two subseries
        contain administrative information about <title type="simple" render="italic">Ms.</title>
        magazine and the Sisterhood is Global Institute. The Subjects Series is restricted: patrons
        must sign an Acknowledgment of Legal Rights and Responsibilities form before using the
        materials. </p>
      <p>The smaller <emph render="bold">Personal Files Series</emph> offers materials related to
        Robin Morgan's education, early critical writing, and her many trips overseas. The series
        also includes material that Morgan requested under the Freedom of Information Act from the
        FBI and CIA about her own activities. </p>
      <p>The documents in the <emph render="bold">Teaching Materials Series</emph> are primarily
        related to Morgan's academic positions at New College (Sarasota, Fla.) and the University of
        Denver, and the courses she taught on feminism and writing. The files include both
        administrative documentation as well as actual course material, but there are also clippings
        related to feminist protests on campus.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">The Audio-Visual Materials Series</emph> contains numerous interviews
        on cassette tapes that Morgan conducted in the Middle East, a recording of her reading of
        selected poems from <title type="simple" render="italic">A Hot January</title>, and a
        videotape about the production of <title type="simple" render="italic">Saturday's
          Child.</title> Permission is not granted to publish interviews conducted in the Middle
        East; the researcher is responsible for obtaining permission to publish. Original copies of
        audiovisual materials are not open to use; however, use copies are available to
        researchers.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Photographic and Visual Materials Series</emph> provides a small
        visual supplement to the other documents in the collection and includes portrait photographs
        of Morgan taken by the press and by her close friends, as well as snapshots of social
        gatherings. This series also includes two painted portraits of Morgan. <emph render="bold"

          <p>The series is divided into two subseries: <emph render="bold">Correspondence by
              Name</emph> and <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Decade</emph>, both of which
            contain letters to and from Robin Morgan. The <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Name
              Subseries</emph> is organized alphabetically by last name or place. Prominent
            correspondents include feminists such as Simone de Beauvoir, Sallie Bingham, Kate
            Millett, Adrienne Rich, and Gloria Steinem. There are also letters of a personal nature
            with Morgan's mother, aunts, and close friends, such as Vladimir Urban. Particularly
            voluminous is the correspondence from Isel Rivero (further documented in the <emph
              render="bold">Photographic and Visual Materials Series</emph>), with whom Robin Morgan
            maintained a close relationship during the 1980s, and from Jane Alpert. The latter
            provides interesting insights into a woman's life in the underground and in prison
            during the mid-1970s. </p>
          <p>While there are several letters in the <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Decade
              Subseries</emph> that date from the 1950s and 1960s (including a letter from Nehru),
            the bulk of the correspondence comes from the 1990s. Material from this decade includes
            letters of both a personal and professional nature; one group of folders contains
            correspondence pertaining solely to the period during which Morgan was <title
              type="simple" render="italic">Ms.</title> magazine's editor in chief. In this
            subseries, the correspondence is arranged in original order, by decade only.</p>

          <p>Largest in the collection, the <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph> contains
            drafts, notes, manuscripts, reviews, and correspondence (both with editors and readers),
            as well as other material such as contracts and copyright agreements related to Morgan's
            novels, anthologies, and poetry. Individual subseries, arranged alphabetically, contain
            material relating to almost all of Morgan's book-length published works. Within each
            subseries, documents are in the original order to reflect the publishing process.
            Materials in the <emph render="bold">Poems</emph>, <emph render="bold">Other Writings by
              Morgan</emph>, <emph render="bold">Writings by Others,</emph> and <emph render="bold"
              >Grants</emph> subseries are all in chronological order. </p>
          <p>The material related to the production of the <title type="simple" render="italic"
              >Sisterhood is Global </title>anthology is particularly extensive. It includes files
            on individual contributors, which contain ephemeral publications and correspondence
            providing insights into the lives of women in different parts of the world. Less
            extensive material on shorter published and unpublished works can be found in the <emph
              render="bold">Poems Subseries </emph>and <emph render="bold">Other Writings by Morgan
              Subseries</emph>. Particularly noteworthy in the latter are samples of Morgan's
            earliest writings, which reveal an acute sense of humour and sensitivity at an early
            age, and the many folders of Morgan's comments on other women's works. Finally, at the
            end of the <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph>, there are a few manuscripts by
            other authors, including poetry and a dissertation about Morgan's work. </p>

          <p>Approximately one third of the series consists of drafts of Morgan's speeches;
            interviews of Morgan by Dorothy Dinnerstein, Chai Lin and Helen Cooper; and material
            about her joint poetry tour with Kenneth Pitchford. The remaining two thirds of the
            material is documents related to Morgan's speeches and interviews (chiefly
            correspondence, schedules, and contracts). All material is in alphabetical order.
            Several announcements of Morgan's speeches are located in the <emph render="bold"

          <p>The <emph render="bold">Subject Files Series</emph> is organized into five subseries.
            Apart from the <emph render="bold">International Feminist Activism and Resources
              Subseries</emph>, which is organized by continents, all material within individual
            subseries is in alphabetical order. Formats include newspaper clippings, ephemeral
            publications, short articles, and official letters and documents.</p>
          <p>The <emph render="bold">General Subseries</emph> includes documentation about a
            controversial plagiarism case involving Robin Morgan, as well as material documenting
            Morgan's service with Hands Across America. The <emph render="bold">International
              Feminist Activism and Resources Subseries</emph> documents feminist activism all over
            the world. The most substantial material comes from South Africa and the Middle East,
            where Morgan spent months in the Palestinian refugee camps. The <emph render="bold"
                ><title type="simple" render="italic">Ms.</title> Subseries</emph> contains minutes
            and memos from editorial meetings, information about distribution, and some
            correspondence with readers. A large portion of the subseries comes from the years when
            Morgan acted as editor-in chief (1989-1993) and re-launched the magazine as an
            international bimonthly free of advertising. There is also material concerning the 1980
            issue of <title type="simple" render="italic">Ms.</title> about Russian women and Soviet
            feminism. The Sisterhood Is Global Institute Subseries contains some annual reports and
            other institutional documents. Finally, the <emph render="bold">U.S. Feminist Activism
              and Resources Subseries</emph> consists of subject files that cover a number of
            topics, including witchcraft, demonstrations against the Miss America Pageant, women's
            clinics, and anti-pornography campaigns. There are also several documents about feminist
            conferences in the United States and some material concerning figures such as Gloria
            Steinem, Marilyn Waring, and Patricia Hearst. A complete set of issues of <title

            is located in the <emph render="bold">Oversize Materials</emph>.</p>

          <p>Consists primarily of papers related to Robin Morgan's formal education at Columbia
            University. Formats include class notes, essays, and rather brief notebooks from her
            trips to the Middle East, Austria and Egypt, further documented in the <emph
              render="bold">Photographic and Visual Materials Series</emph> and <emph render="bold"
              >Subject Files Series</emph>. Other material includes FBI and CIA files, which Morgan
            requested through the Freedom of Information Act in the 1970s. Each of the three
            categories (Education at Columbia University, Trips, and Other Personal) is arranged in
            chronological order.</p>

          <p>Accession (2010-0176) (18,450 items; 24.6 lin. ft.; dated 1947-2010) includes Morgan's
            travel files, correspondence, <title type="simple" render="italic">Ms.</title> editorial
            files, and materials from her research and publications. General correspondence (dating
            1996-2009) consists of email printouts and letters detailing Morgan's activities with
            various projects, conferences, and boards, including Equality Now and the February
            Sisters. It also includes her thoughts on the 2008 presidential election, including a
            re-written version of <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Goodbye to All
              That</title> discussing the Hillary Clinton campaign.</p>
          <p>The <title type="simple" render="italic">Ms.</title> files (dating 2002-2010) include
            global dispatches, correspondence, and cover story interviews by Morgan of Madeleine
            Albright and Jane Fonda. This section also contains files from the <title type="simple"
              render="italic">Ms.</title> search for editor-in-chief.</p>
          <p>A large portion of the accession relates to Morgan's writings, poetry, and published
            books. These materials consist of drafts, correspondence with publishers, publicity and
            press, reader reactions, reviews of her work, and rights permissions. Works represented
            include <title type="simple" render="italic">Monster</title>, which included the poem
              <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Arraignment;</title><title type="simple"
              render="doublequote">The Mysteries,</title> a play; <title type="simple"
              render="italic">Upstairs in the Garden</title>; <title type="simple" render="italic"
              >Going Too Far</title>; <title type="simple" render="italic">The Anatomy of
              Freedom</title>; <title type="simple" render="italic">The Witch Tales</title>; <title
              type="simple" render="italic">Sisterhood is Forever</title>; and other poems and
            articles. The majority of the <title type="simple" render="italic">Sisterhood is
              Forever</title> materials are contributor files, including women like Gloria Steinem,
            Eleanor Smeal, Eve Ensler, Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, and many others.</p>
          <p>Also represented are supporting materials, mainly clippings and other miscellaneous
            items, from Morgan's childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood that she used for
            writing her <title type="simple" render="italic">Memoirs</title>. These clippings
            include coverage of her activities as a child star on the television show <title
              type="simple" render="italic">Mama</title>, as well as her other performances, radio
            and television shows, and modelling engagements. Morgan's early activities in the
            women's liberation movement are also represented in these clippings, such as her
            protesting the Miss America competition in 1969 and coverage of her book, <title
              type="simple" render="italic">Sisterhood Is Powerful</title>. The original clippings
            are extremely fragile and may require Technical Services intervention.</p>
          <p>Other materials in the accession include various research and project files, many
            supporting Morgan's activities or writings. For example, there is a series of folders on
            clitoredectomy and female genital mutilation, culminating in a draft prepared by Morgan
            and Gloria Steinem of an article published in the 1970s. Materials from the Women's
            Media Center are closed due to restrictions. There is also a significant amount of
            audiovisual material, including film, VHS, reel-to-reel audio, and DVDs. These will
            require reformatting prior to use by researchers.</p>
