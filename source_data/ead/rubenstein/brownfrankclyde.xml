        Collection centers around Frank Clyde Brown's lifelong exploration and collecting of North
        Carolina and Appalachian folklore, which resulted in this vast archival collection of
        original folklore materials and editorial records for the seven-volume <emph>Frank C. Brown
          Collection of North Carolina Folklore</emph> (published 1952-1964). Collection is
        comprised of field recordings on wax cylinders and phonodiscs; tens of thousands of field
        notes, transcriptions of original songs, stories, and traditional expressions; musical
        scores; and numerous journal articles, student theses, books, and lists. Also included are
        the papers of Charles Bond, a Duke graduate student who studied and expanded the collection
        in 1970. The vast majority of the folklore sources originated in North Carolina, but there
        are some materials from other regions. Subjects include: African American traditions;
        ballads and songs (music as well as lyrics); European roots of North American folklore; folk
        music; folk poetry; games and parties; oral traditions and storytelling; sayings, names, and
        superstitions; social conditions in the Southern States; work songs; and North American
        folklore in general. In addition, one can find rich resources on the study and teaching of
        folklore, and attitudes during the 1920s to 1950s about Southern customs and
        communities.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical and Historical Note</head>
      <p>Frank Clyde Brown (1870-1943) served as a Professor of English at Trinity College, Duke
        University, from 1909 until his death. A native of Virginia, he received his Ph.D. at the
        University of Chicago in 1908. While at Duke University he served in many capacities,
        including chairman of his department, University Marshal, and Comptroller of the University
        during its initial construction. These aspects of his life are chronicled in his papers held
        by the <extref xlink:href="http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/uabrownfc/">Duke
          University Archives</extref>.</p>
      <p>This collection of materials, however, is concerned with activities to which he devoted
        equal time and energy, the organization of the North Carolina Folklore Society in 1913 and
        his personal effort to gather and record the nuances and culture of "folk" of North Carolina
        and its near neighbors, which occupied him from 1912 until his death. Under the impetus of a
        1912 mailing from John A. Lomax, then President of the American Folklore Society, Brown as
        well as other faculty members and other citizens in North Carolina, became interested in
        folklore and organized the North Carolina Folklore Society in 1913, with Brown as
        secretary-treasurer. As secretary-treasurer of this organization from its inception until
        his death, he provided the organizational impetus behind the Society. </p>
      <p>Through his course in folklore at Duke, he also sent class after class out to gather the
        folklore of their locales, both during their studies and afterward. And virtually every
        summer he could be found in the most remote parts of the state, with notebook and recorder
        -- first a dictaphone employing cylinders, and later a machine employing aluminum discs
        provided for his use by the University. The result, by 1943, was a vast collection of field
        notes, hundreds of musical scores, thousands of audio recordings, and numerous magazine
        articles, student theses, books, lists, and other items related to this study. The majority
        of the material originated in North Carolina, with the rest from 20 other states and Canada,
        and came from the efforts of 650 other contributors besides Brown himself.</p>
      <p>Although Brown promised the Society on an almost yearly basis to publish at least part of
        this collection to which its members were contributing, he never took more than a few
        tentative steps toward doing so. Thus, at Brown's death in 1943, Newman Ivey White, also a
        Professor of English at Duke University, close colleague of Brown's, and charged by Brown
        with continuing the work, inherited the dual confusion of the folklore collection, which was
        piled in Brown's attic office at home, and the conflicting claims of ownership of the
        collection of Mrs. Brown, the North Carolina Folklore Society, and Duke University. When it
        became apparent that all were amenable to seeing the collection in print, White assumed the
        post of general editor, which passed to Paull Franklin Baum, also a Professor of English and
        Director of the Duke Press, after White's death in 1948.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection centers around folklorist Frank Clyde Brown's papers related to his lifelong
        exploration and collecting of North Carolina and Appalachian folklore, which resulted in
        this vast archival collection of original folklore materials and editorial records for the
        project which published Brown's work in seven volumes as (<title render="italic">The Frank
          C. Brown Collection of North Carolina Folklore</title>, 1952-1964. Materials comprise
        about 1,049 tunes and songs recorded on wax cylinders and lacquer and aluminum phonodiscs,
        backup copies of the recordings on glass lacquer phonodiscs made by the Library of Congress
        in the 1940s, 30,000 written notes on lore, 650 musical scores, and numerous journal
        articles, student theses, books, lists, and other items. The folklore sources originated in
        at least 84 North Carolina counties, with about 5 percent from 20 other states and Canada,
        and came from the efforts of 650 other contributors besides Brown himself. Also included are
        the research notes and other papers of Charles Bond, a Duke graduate student who dealt with
        the collection in 1970.</p>
      <p>Subjects range widely and include: ballads and songs (music as well as lyrics); European
        roots of North American folklore; folk music; folk poetry; games and parties; oral
        traditions and storytelling; superstitions; social conditions in the Southern States;
        African American traditions; work songs; and North American folklore in general. In
        addition, one can find rich resources on the study and teaching of folklore, and attitudes
        during the 1920s to 1950s about Southern customs and communities.</p>
      <p>The collection is divided into the following series: Cylinders and Discs, which includes
        the Library of Congress glass lacquer phonodisc copies, Personal Papers, General Editors'
        Papers, Associate Editors' Papers, Charles Bond Research Material.</p>
      <p>The Recordings Series includes 1,049 performances on original wax cylinders and phonodiscs,
        re-recordings of the cylinders and discs created by the Library of Congress in the 1940s,
        and supplementary materials. The original wax cylinders and phonodiscs were digitized and
        described as part of a CLIR/Mellon grant in 2015-2018.</p>
      <p>The Personal Papers series includes Brown's correspondence, research files, and the
        extensive materials in the folklore collection, which include transcriptions and sheet
        music. All items were gathered by Brown, and taken over in 1943 by Dr. Newman Ivey White,
        who served as first general editor of the project from its inception then until his death in
        1948. The General Editors' Papers include items which were related to and produced by the
        work of White, and Paull Franklin Baum who assumed duties at White's death, and saw the
        project through to its completion in 1964. The Associate Editors' Papers have been organized
        by editor, and include drafts and typescripts for various volumes. </p>
      <p>The Charles Bond Research Material Series stems from the work of Charles Bond, a student of
        Professor Holger O. Nygard at Duke University. Bond opened the archival collection in
        1970-1971, and prepared both an outline as well as a Tabulation of Unpublished Items in the
        collection. This series also includes correspondence, an index, and card files. </p>

          <p>The Personal Papers series includes all items gathered by Brown during his career as
            folklorist and ethnomusicologist; these materials were taken over in 1943 by Dr. Newman
            Ivey White, who served as first general editor of the project from its inception then
            until his death in 1948. Brown's personal correspondence relates to his folklore study
            and is filed alphabetically. It includes an extensive alphabetical index and a
            chronological card index, both prepared for the editorial project. Correspondents
            include local folklorists and fellow professors. Other papers include composition books
            with fragmented transcriptions of folklore findings, a draft of a talk on folklore,
            photographs of Brown, and some printed material. </p>
          <p>The vast folklore collection itself is filed alphabetically by contributor (the person
            who passed the folklore to Brown, not necessarily the person who knew the "lore"
            submitted to begin with) and also includes anonymous contributions. These "manuscripts,"
            as Newman White labeled them, are the earliest extant record of the contributions,
            ranging from scrawled pencil notes on scrap pieces of paper to typescripts made by Brown
            and others from memory or made for one of his many efforts to publish a portion of the
            collection at various points in his life. Occasionally such a typescript will hold
            contributions of more than one person, and in such a case it is filed with one of the
            contributors, with cross-references. Especially prominent among the contributors is
            Maude Minish Sutton, a fellow folklorist, who gave Brown the use of her large findings
            of songs and games, among other contributions, along with her often voluminous notes on
            these items. </p>
          <p>Part of the folklore collection features folders of clippings gathered by Brown,
            arranged according to Brown's classification scheme, described below. Another portion of
            this series is the Papers and Articles subseries, which contains auxiliary folklore
            information gathered throughout Brown's effects by White and arranged in rough
            alphabetical order. These materials include specialized bibliographies, student papers,
            and printed items.</p>

          <p>Drafts of publication include the table of contents, title page, and other materials,
            for Volume 1 and of the general introduction, as well as other miscellaneous materials.
            Successive progress reports on the project include the Classification Scheme, where
            White sets out an extended version of Brown's sixteen-point system of folklore
            classification by which White organized the folklore contributions. Divisions set out
            included: husbandry, omens, tokens, luck-signs, folk-medicine, magic, divination,
            housewifery, folk-sermons, pseudoscience, words, place-names, riddles and sayings,
            children's sayings, games, customs, legends, ballads, and songs. The series also
            includes newspaper and magazine reviews, correspondence, financial papers, and
            administrative materials. </p>
          <p>Finally, the series includes a vast collection of folklore typescripts, both original
            and carbon copies, of each item in the collection, arranged according to the
            Classification Scheme. These were prepared by White. There are numerous references to
            African American customs as well as folklore traditions in Europe carried over to the
            United States.</p>

          <p>The Charles Bond's Research Material Series stems from the work of Charles Bond, a
            student of Professor Holger O. Nygard of Duke University. Bond opened the collection in
            1970-1971, and prepared both an outline as well as a Tabulation of Unpublished Items in
            the collection. This series also includes correspondence, an index, and card files.</p>
