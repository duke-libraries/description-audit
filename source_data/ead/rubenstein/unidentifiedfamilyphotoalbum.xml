        in several different hands. The 159 photographs either document family travel as souvenirs,
        or document both their travel and photograph collecting, because many of the photographs are
        albumen prints by famous late-19th-century photographers, including Bonfils, Zangaki, Samuel
        Bourne, Francis Frith, and others not identified except by the presence of their negative
        numbers and captions on the photograph. From these photographers there are images of Israel;
        Syria; Palestine; Jerusalem; Athens, Greece; and Agra, India, along with photographs of
        statues and other artifacts recovered in archaeological digs. Other photographs in the album
        were probably taken by family members, first in Venice, then in various places, including
        Scotland, England, and Jamaica. Among these photographs are albumen and cyanotype prints.
        Photographs in the album date between 1850 and 1897, and range in size from 1.5 x 2-inches

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection comprises a photograph album maintained by an unidentified wealthy, possibly
        British, family; handwritten captions appear in several different hands. The 159 photographs
        either document family travel as souvenirs, or document both their travel and photograph
        collecting, because many of the photographs are albumen prints by famous late-19th-century
        photographers, including Bonfils, Zangaki, Samuel Bourne, Francis Frith, and others not
        identified except by the presence of their negative numbers and captions on the photograph. </p>
      <p>From these photographers there are images of Israel; Syria; Palestine; Jerusalem; Athens,
        Greece; and Agra, India, along with photographs of statues and other artifacts recovered in
        archaeological digs. Other photographs in the album were probably taken by family members,
        first in Venice, then in various places, including Scotland, England, and Jamaica. Among
        these photographs are albumen and cyanotype prints. Photographs in the album date somewhere
        between 1850 and 1897, and range in size from 1.5 x 2-inches to 8.5 x 11.5 inches. Acquired
        as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts. </p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>Pages 138-186 of the album contain family photographs, incuding 46 albumen and 30 cyanotype
        photographs of individuals, groups, and animals, as well as a few photographs taken in
        Jamaica, Scotland, England, and other locations. The majority of these prints are
        3.5x4.5-inches, although a few are 1.5 x 2-inches and up to 8x10-inches. The photographs are
        often accompanied by handwritten captions, and are dated between 1892-1897. A few
        photographs and captions have been removed from this section of the album. A photograph list
        has been housed with the item.</p>
