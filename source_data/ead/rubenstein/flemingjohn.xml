      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The collection includes Fleming's personal files, administrative materials, and collected
        documents from his education and professional life as a professor and museum administrator.
        Files have been arranged into series: Writings, Organizational Files, Museum Leadership,
        Printed Materials and Research, Asa Spaulding Project, Education, Personal, and
        Correspondence. The bulk of the collection is held in the Organizational Files and Museum
        Leadership series.</p>
      <p>The Organizational Files Series contains a large subseries of Fleming's Consulting Work, as
        well as files from Fleming's membership and service to groups like ASALH, AAAM, Sigma Pi
        Phi, and other civic or professional organizations. This series also includes Fleming's
        board work with Berea College, the Ohio Humanities Council, the American Civil War Center,
        and other historically-minded groups.</p>
      <p>The Museum Leadership Series is arranged by museum; Fleming served as director or in some
        executive capacity with each of the museums in this series. Most subseries include his
        correspondence, planning and design materials, exhibition materials, and other documents
        accounting for the early operations of the museums. Also included in this series are
        materials from the America I Am exhibit, which Fleming produced. Two of the subseries are
        restricted: the International African American Museum subseries is closed until 2018, and
        the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum is closed until 2017.</p>
      <p>The rest of the collection's series are relatively smaller, in terms of volume. The
        Writings Series includes Fleming's speeches and publications; files are arranged by format
        and then alphabetically by title. Printed Materials and Research include his clippings,
        articles, and publications he kept as reference materials for his museum work and academic
        research. The Asa Spaulding Project includes oral history notes, transcripts, and cassette
        tapes from Fleming's work as a research assistant for Spaulding's autobiography. The
        Education Series includes coursework and notes from his own college and graduate courses, as
        well as files from his teaching at Howard University following his graduation. The Personal
        Series contains an assortment of materials, including job searches, clippings about him and
        his family, and other ephemera. Finally, Fleming's Correspondence Series includes both
        personal and professional communications, which are arranged in a loose chronological order
        by year.</p>

      <p>John E. Fleming (1944- ) is originally from Morganton, N.C., and graduated from Berea

        Fleming was the founding director of the National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center

            <p>Fleming was a Senior Fellow at the Institute for the Study of Educational Policy from
              1974 to 1980. This subseries is divided into two parts: Fleming's subject files,
              collected during his time at ISEP, and then general files from his work at ISEP. Many
              of the materials focus on the impact and viability of affirmative action in higher
              education. Another notable project Fleming worked on during this period was the E
              Pluribus Unum project with Miami Dade Communite College, which sought to develop a new
              curriculum or textbook for the teaching of American history. Additional materials from
              Fleming's work at ISEP can be found in the Writings Series.</p>

          <p>This series consists largely of Fleming's notes and interview transcripts from his work
            as a research assistant for Asa Spaulding, who intended to write an autobiography in the
            early 1980s. Fleming conducted oral history interviews with many of Spaulding's
            acquaintances and colleagues in support of the project, and also researched Spaulding's
            personal history. Some audiotapes of interviews are available for research. Transcripts
            and notes are arranged alphabetically by interviewee.</p>

          <p>The majority of this series consists of Fleming's correspondence, both personal and
            professional, which has been loosely arranged by year. Three files at the end of the
            series are segregated by subject, representing how they were originally donated to the
            Rubenstein: Fleming's correspondence with Berea College; Fleming's correspondence with
            Mary Ann Olding over her dissertation process; and Fleming's correspondence about the
            Selective Service and his status as a Conscientious Objector during the Vietnam War.</p>
