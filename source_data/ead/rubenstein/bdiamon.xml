        advocate for the arts, interviewer, documentarian, teacher, political organizer, and
        resident of New York City. Her collection comprises research files, correspondence, audio
        and video recordings, printed materials, photographs, scrapbooks, artifacts, and artwork,
        all deriving from Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel's books, educational programming,
        interviews, public art installations, and exhibits centering on the arts, architecture, and
        historic preservation in the United States. The materials highlight her work with many arts
        and political organizations and her appointments to committees such as the Commission for
        Cultural Affairs and the New York Landmarks Preservation Commission. Topics include: art and
        architecture in the 20th century; gender and society; historic preservation; media and
        society; social conditions in Slovakia during her husband's ambassadorship there; U.S.
        politics and public policy, particularly related to the Democratic Party; women and the
        arts; women's rights; and many others. Early materials dating from 1929 to 1965 document her
        family history and early personal life. The collection also includes some materials
        concerning her husband, Carl Spielvogel, whose papers are also in the Rubenstein Library.
        Over one hundred of her television interviews with notable artists and other figures have
        been digitized by the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Video Archive at Duke University and are
        available online.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Spanning 1876 to 2020, with the bulk of the materials dating from 1950 to the 2010s, the
        Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel Collection documents the life and career of a pioneering
        advocate for art, architecture, historical preservation, and public policy. The collection
        comprises over 650 boxes of research files, correspondence, printed materials, photographs,
        memorabilia, artifacts, and artwork, all stemming from Diamonstein-Spielvogel's long career
        and her prolific output of books, educational programming, interviews, public art
        installations, and exhibits. The materials highlight her work with many arts and political
        organizations and her appointments to committees such as the Commission for Cultural Affairs
        and the New York Landmarks Preservation Commission. Over one hundred of her television
        interviews with notable artists and other figures have been digitized by the
        Diamonstein-Spielvogel Video Archive at Duke University.</p>
      <p>Topics covered by the materials in this collection include broad categories such as art and
        architecture in the 20th century; historic preservation and the protection of cultural
        property; media and society; social conditions, women's rights and the arts in Slovakia
        during her husband's ambassadorship there; U.S. and overseas politics, particularly related
        to the Democratic Party; U.S. public policy, with a focus on the arts; the built
        environment; women and the arts; gender issues and women's rights; travel abroad; and many
        others. Early materials dating from 1929 to 1965 - chiefly correspondence, writings, and
        photographs - document family history, her education, and her earliest career in teaching.
        Other early dates in the collection refer to reproductions of 19th century images chiefly
        found in exhibit and research files.</p>
      <p>The collection is divided into series: Correspondence, Writings, Personal Files, Political
        Files, Professional Files, Art and Architecture Project Files, Art and Design Project Files,
        Historic Preservation Project Files, Scrapbooks and Visual Arts Materials. </p>
      <p>Taken as a whole, the collection offers rich documentation on the evolution of art and
        architecture in the U.S., the development of adaptive reuse and landmarks legislation, the
        relationship of public policy to the arts, and the interplay between public policy and the
        built environment. Materials from Diamonstein-Spielvogel's personal and research files also
        document the changing roles of men and women in the United States, and the development of
        U.S. gender studies; not only did she write on the subject, but her own experiences reveal
        aspects of women in the workforce, in politics and activist movements, and in positions of
        authority. Additionally, because of her work for the White House and the Democratic Party,
        the collection offers insights into 20th century U.S. politics, nationally and in her home
        state of New York.</p>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Throughout her career, Dr. Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel has served as a leading voice
        on some of the defining urban issues of our time, especially preservation of the historic
        built environment. She is a pioneering advocate of the arts, with interests in architecture,
        design and public policy. The first Director of Cultural Affairs for New York City, she
        brought the first public art to Bryant Park in 1967, and the first public performance by the
        Metropolitan Opera to Central Park. She was the longest-serving Landmarks Preservation
        Commissioner in the city's history, spanning the administrations of Mayors Lindsay, Beame,
        Koch, Dinkins and Giuliani from 1972 to 1987. She has also served as the Commissioner of the
        New York City Arts/Public Design Commission and of the New York City Cultural Commission, as
        the Chair of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Foundation (1987-1995), and since 1995
        has been the Chair of the Historic Landmarks Preservation Center.</p>
      <p>Diamonstein-Spielvogel has served under four presidential administrations. As part of the

        the board of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.; and by President
        Clinton to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, where she was elected the first woman vice
        chair in its more than 100-year history. In 2010, President Obama appointed her a
        commissioner of the American Battle Monuments Commission. She was named the vice chair of
        the New York State Council on the Arts in 2008 and chair in 2016. In 2012, she was appointed
        to advise the Port Authority on the integration of public art and architecture into the
        World Trade Center site. Diamonstein-Spielvogel also has been active in many state and
        national Democratic campaigns.</p>

        her interviews with artists, architects, designers, and other notables have been digitized
        and made available on iTunes and YouTube as part of the Duke University Video Archive. In
        October 2010, Duke initiated the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Visiting Filmmaker Series to address
        contemporary issues of social, political, economic, and cultural urgency from a global
        perspective.</p>
      <p>Diamonstein-Spielvogel has served on the boards of numerous national and local institutions
        and organizations, including recent service in support of the Fresh Air Fund, the Drawing
        Committee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Acquisitions Committee of the Cooper-Hewitt
        National Design Museum, and the N.Y. Museum of Modern Art. She is a founding director of the

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>This series predominantly consists of Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel's incoming
            correspondence but also contains some drafts and copies of materials sent by
            Diamonstein-Spielvogel. The content generally centers on the logistics, planning,
            research, and creative energy behind her work, and the personal and professional
            relationships with friends, political figures, and business and project partners. There
            is a large overlap between personal and professional content.</p>

            cards pertaining to her travels, early career efforts, her marriage, and daily life. The
            later correspondence contains a significant amount of correspondence from notable
            figures such as Hillary Rodham Clinton, Dale Chihuly, Mario Buatta, and Louise Nevelson,
            among others. Often accompanying the letters are clippings and photographs, as well as
            printed materials such as invitations, fliers, advertisements, and pamphlets. The
            majority of the correspondence from the 2010s is email printouts. </p>

            to specific projects, organizations, or other activities. Letters from family members

            <p>One of her largest and most comprehensive articles dealing with women in American
              society, Singular Voices: 100 Women in Touch with our Time contains many similarly
              titled subheadings because the article went through numerous title changes during its
              creation. This article grew into Diamonstein-Spielvogel's book, Open Secrets, and

            <p>Files in the subseries house many black-and-white and color photographs and slides.
              Subjects include family members, friends, and artwork, as well as personal events and
              vacations covering a period of time from before Diamonstein-Spielvogel's birth to
              2008. Highlights include early black-and-white portraits of Diamonstein-Spielvogel's
              family, the Dworkins. Other photographs are located throughout the collection.</p>
            <p>The subseries is arranged in two folder groups: the first arranged alphabetically by
              folder title; the other chronologically by year, with undated materials at the end.
              Most titles have been supplied by the project archivist.</p>

            <p>Subseries consists of folders assembled and maintained by Diamonstein-Spielvogel that
              document the life and work of her husband Carl Spielvogel. Materials include
              correspondence, notes, printed matter, photographs, clippings, and awards and
              certificates, as well as a small amount of personal correspondence and other
              manuscript materials. The earliest materials predate their acquaintance; the couple
              married in 1981.</p>
            <p>Spielvogel is an international business executive who began working as a journalist
              for The New York Times and later became a leader in the advertising business working
              with Backer Spielvogel and Bates, Incorporated. He served as the U.S. Ambassador to
              the Slovak Republic from 2000-2001.</p>
            <p>Other materials pertaining to Spielvogel's appointment as Ambassador are located in
              the Ambassador Subseries of the Professional Series. Some materials related to Carl
              Spielvogel are also located in the General Working Files Subseries of the Personal
              Series and are scattered throughout the collection.</p>
            <p>Carl Spielvogel's professional papers documenting his advertising and political
              career are housed at the John W. Hartman Center for Sales, Advertising and Marketing
              History at Duke University.</p>
            <p>Arranged alphabetically by folder title. Original folder titles are retained.</p>

          <p>The relationship between art, culture, and public policy is highlighted by the
            materials in this series, which derive from Diamonstein-Spielvogel's political
            appointments under four U.S. presidents: Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton,
            and Barack Obama. Formats present in the series include extensive notes, correspondence,
            meeting minutes, memoranda, printed matter, clippings, ledgers, photographs, official
            Certificates of Appointment, and small artifacts such as political pins. The materials
            also document Diamonstein-Spielvogel's political activities and interests on national
            and local levels.</p>
          <p>Diamonstein-Spielvogel served as a White House aide from 1963 to 1966 under President
            Lyndon B. Johnson's administration, and her political binders, notes and correspondence
            not only highlight the general political climate at the time, but also reveal her
            efforts to incorporate art and culture programs and initiatives into the Presidency. In
            her subsequent political appointments to the administrations of Presidents Reagan,
            Clinton and Obama, Diamonstein-Spielvogel was called upon for her expertise in the arts
            and public policy, as her correspondence and meeting materials attest.</p>
          <p>Divided into five subseries based on her appointments.</p>

            <p>Subseries consists of correspondence, notes, clippings, official documents, small
              artifacts such as political pins, ledgers, memoranda, drafts, photographs, clippings,
              and printed matter pertaining to Diamonstein-Spielvogel's work as a White House Aide
              (1963-1966) to Eric Goldman under the Johnson administration. There is a small amount
              of materials documenting Diamonstein-Spielvogel's work for the TV series Open Mind,
              then hosted by Goldman, as well as drafts and correspondence from the writing of
              Goldman's book The Tragedy of Lyndon Johnson.</p>
            <p>Highlights also include materials surrounding the inauguration of the White House
              Fellows Program and the Presidential Scholars Program. Also of particular note is
              documentation of the first and only White House Festival of the Arts organized by
              Diamonstein-Spielvogel, which speaks to the interaction of art and politics. Other
              materials relevant to this series exist in small amounts in the Correspondence
              Series.</p>
            <p>The subseries is arranged chronologically. Two larger groupings of folders are
              present within this chronology: the Festival of the Arts group contains materials
              related to the White House Festival of the Arts and is arranged alphabetically; the
              White House Binders group contains folders of professional White House papers
              originally maintained in binders by Diamonstein-Spielvogel. Original order and folder
              titles have been retained.</p>

            <p>Diamonstein-Spielvogel's role as Commissioner on the Fine Arts under the Clinton
              administration (1992) is documented here through correspondence, meeting minutes,
              notes, official documents, certificates, clippings, and printed materials. The
              Commission of Fine Arts advises the U.S. government on issues of design and aesthetics
              as they affect the nation's interests and the Capitol. Highlights include materials
              related to the creation of the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. Materials are
              arranged chronological order; original folder titles have been retained.</p>

            <p>This subseries comprises materials pertaining to Diamonstein-Spielvogel's from
              activities and interests related to her residency in Slovakia, stemming from the
              appointment of her husband, Carl Spielvogel, to Ambassador to that country from 2000
              to 2001. Formats documenting her work include clippings, notes, correspondence,
              printed materials, photographs, and some artifacts. Diamonstein-Spielvogel's work was
              two-fold: she aided her husband in his position as ambassador, and she turned to
              documenting and supporting the art, culture, and quality of life of Slovakians,
              becoming especially concerned with issues relating to the status of women and the Roma
              people in Eastern Europe. Some materials are in the Slovak language.</p>
            <p>Highlights include materials pertaining to her work on The Plight of the Roma, an
              international conference in 2004 discussing the history of the Roma and addressing the
              racial and social discrimination and human rights concerns of their current situation
              with keynote speaker Hillary Clinton.</p>
            <p>Some related audiovisual materials are located in the Barbaralee
              Diamonstein-Spielvogel Audiovisual Materials Collection.</p>

            <p>This largest subseries within the Professional Files Series contains correspondence,
              minutes, reports, notes, photographs, clippings, proposals, printed matter, budgets,
              schedules, and other routine administrative materials related to organizations,
              chiefly in the U.S., with which Diamonstein-Spielvogel was affiliated or played an
              active role. Earliest dates come from copies of organizational charters. Audiovisual
              materials are located in the Program Subseries of the Audiovisual Materials
              Series.</p>
            <p>Highlights include materials documenting Diamonstein-Spielvogel's ongoing work with
              Duke University from 1976 to the present, as well as materials surrounding her work on
              the Commission of Cultural Affairs of New York City, where she brought the first
              public art to Bryant Park. Also of particular interest are materials surrounding her
              role as advisor to the Port Authority on the integration of public art and
              architecture into the World Trade Center site following 9/11.</p>
            <p>The subseries is arranged alphabetically by organization. Original folder titles have
              been retained.</p>

            <p>Various photographs relating to Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel's professional work
              or affiliations. Earliest dates are copies of historical photographs most likely used

            <p>Folder titles are generally created based on text on or with the photograph or image
              depicted, and thus are only estimations or generalizations of the subject of the
              photograph. Photographs for which the precise context is known are maintained in the
              appropriate series and folders and not in this format-based subseries. Arranged

          <p>This series is divided into specific projects, whose files typically contain
            correspondence, clippings, notes, photographs, slides, interviews, printed materials and
            other administrative files chiefly pertaining to Diamonstein-Spielvogel's television
            programs, books, and exhibits whose theme focused mainly on architecture as livable art,
            predominantly in New York and the United States. Some of the materials also speak to
            Diamonstein-Spielvogel's strong interest in adaptive reuse and historic
            preservation.</p>
          <p>Materials with earliest dates are from newspaper clippings or copies of clippings used
            in research. Similar materials pertaining to specific projects, organizations or other
            activities are included with those materials in other series in the collection; however,
            a small amount may be present throughout this section. </p>
          <p>Numerous interviews and program clips corresponding to these manuscript materials are
            located in the Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel Audiovisual Materials Collection.</p>

              installment of the television series and corresponding book based on
              Diamonstein-Spielvogel's interviews of prominent architects.</p>
            <p>Interviews were conducted by Diamonstein-Spielvogel over a two-year period from 1982

              Brown, William Conklin, Peter Eisenman, Romaldo Giurgola, Hugh Jacobsen, Philip
              Johnson, Michael Pittas, Kevin Roche, Jaquelin (Jack) Robertson, Benjamin Thompson,
              Stanley Tigerman, and Robert Venturi.</p>
            <p>Additional interviews for inclusion in the book were held with Emilio Ambasz, John
              Burgee, Harry Cobb, Alexander Cooper, Arthur Drexler, Ulrich Franzen, James Freed,
              Bruce Graham, John Hejduk, Helmut Jahn, Gyo Obata, William Pedersen, Norman Pfeiffer,
              Vincent Scully, Edward Vorsanger, James Wines, and Richard Wurman.</p>
            <p>The series is arranged into three subseries: General Working Files, Research Files,
              and Transcripts. General Working Files and Research Files are arranged alphabetically
              by folder title. Original folder titles have been retained. The Transcripts Subseries
              is arranged alphabetically by interviewee name.</p>
            <p>Numerous interviews and program clips corresponding to these manuscript materials are
              located in the the Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel Audiovisual Materials
              Collection.</p>

            <p>This subseries documents a centennial project for the Architectural League of New
              York, designed, organized and implemented by Diamonstein-Spielvogel and considered by
              her to be one of her greatest accomplishments. The project commissioned eleven teams
              of well-known artists and architects to address the crucial problems of the urban
              environment of the next decade (the 1990s), and resolve them in a collaboration that
              resulted in designs, scale models, drawings, an exhibition module, and wall text.
              Other participants included Paul Goldberg (architecture critic, New York Times), Prof.
              Vincent Scully (Yale), and Massimo Vignelli, exhibit and catalogue designer.</p>
            <p>The folders in this subseries include correspondence with the artists and architects
              pertaining to their creative and collaborative processes, as well as numerous
              photographs, slides, general working files, print materials, notes, and drafts
              pertaining to the creation and production of the exhibit and the corresponding book,
              Collaboration: Artists and Architects.</p>
            <p>There are three sub-groupings: Book, Exhibition, and General Working Files, each
              arranged internally alphabetically by folder title. Original folder titles have been
              retained.</p>

            <p>Subseries contains correspondence, drafts, photographs, printed materials, and
              working files related to Landmarks of New York, a series of books and exhibits created
              by Diamonstein-Spielvogel in the 1990s and 2000s, based on historical sites chosen by
              the New York Landmarks Preservation Commission. There is significant overlap among
              materials from the volumes in the series, Landmarks of New York I-V, as well as
              materials for Landmarks: Eighteen Wonders of the New York World, a children's book.
              Some materials are in Italian, Spanish and French.</p>
            <p>Materials are arranged into ten subseries: Landmarks: Eighteen Wonders of the New
              York World; Landmarks of New York I; Landmarks of New York II; Landmarks of New York
              III; Landmarks of New York IV; Landmarks of New York V; Landmarks of New York
              Photographs; Landmarks of New York Promotional Materials; Potential Projects; and WWOR
              Television Network. All materials are arranged alphabetically by folder title;
              original folder titles have been retained.</p>
            <p>Similar materials pertaining to specific projects, organizations, or other activities
              are included with those materials in other series in the collection; however, a small
              amount may be present throughout the materials in this section as well. Two
              organizations aided in the creation and promotion of Landmarks of New York at various
              times, thus there are significant amounts of materials related to the Landmarks of New
              York in the Historic Landmarks Preservation Commission and the New York Historic
              Landmarks Preservation Foundation sections of the Historic Preservation Project Files
              Series.</p>

            <p>Materials from major projects centering on the re-adaptive use of historical
              buildings in the United States, which culminated in a series of nationally-acclaimed
              books and related exhibits: Buildings Reborn (first volume published in 1979), and
              Remaking America (first volume published in 1986). Formats in the project files
              include correspondence, printed materials (including many articles and clippings),
              photographs, color slides, clippings, photocopies, drafts, notes, and general working
              files. Earliest materials are research copies and are dated based on content rather
              than date of creation.</p>
            <p>Subseries is divided further into Book, Exhibition, General Working Files, and
              Research Files; folders are arranged alphabetically by title. Original folder titles
              have been retained. There is considerable overlap between materials in the General
              Working Files subseries of Buildings Reborn and Remaking America.</p>

            <p>Materials from major projects centering on the re-adaptive use of historical
              buildings in the United States, which culminated in a series of nationally-acclaimed
              books and related exhibits: Buildings Reborn (first volume published in 1979), and
              Remaking America (first volume published in 1986). Formats in the project files
              include correspondence, printed materials (including many articles and clippings),
              photographs, color slides, clippings, photocopies, drafts, notes, and general working
              files. Earliest materials are research copies and are dated based on content rather
              than date of creation.</p>
            <p>Subseries is divided further into Book, Exhibition, General Working Files, and
              Research Files; folders are arranged alphabetically by title. Original folder titles
              have been retained. There is considerable overlap between materials in the General
              Working Files subseries of Buildings Reborn and Remaking America.</p>

            <p>Subseries is composed of materials stemming from Diamonstein-Spielvogel's Handmade in
              America, a book and television series discussing craftsmanship with several American
              artisans, including glass master Dale Chihuly, woodworker and artist Sam Maloof, and
              weaver Lia Cook. Formats chiefly consist of correspondence, printed materials,
              clippings, transcripts, notes, drafts, and other papers.</p>
            <p>Divided into three subseries: General Working Files, Research Files, and Transcripts
              which are arranged alphabetically by folder title. Original folder titles have been
              retained.</p>
            <p>Corresponding interviews and show clips are located in the Barbaralee
              Diamonstein-Spielvogel Audiovisual Materials Collection.</p>

          <p>This series documents Diamonstein-Spielvogel's long-standing interest and efforts in
            historic preservation and the built environment, almost exclusively in the United
            States. Files chiefly contain organizational records such as meeting minutes, agendas,
            correspondence, notes, official applications and forms, accompanied by photographs,
            clippings, and printed materials.</p>
          <p>Of particular interest are materials regarding landmarks laws and regulations assembled
            by Diamonstein-Spielvogel from 1972-1987 during her lengthy term as Landmarks
            Preservation Commissioner. Also of significance are the materials pertaining to the
            ongoing Cultural Medallions Program begun by Diamonstein-Spielvogel.</p>
          <p>Related audiovisual recordings - chiefly publicity, speeches, and celebrations - are
            located in the Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel Audiovisual Materials Collection. </p>

            <p>Materials related to Diamonstein-Spielvogel's ongoing role as Chair of the Historic
              Landmarks Preservation Center where she spearheaded the Cultural Medallion program
              that recognizes buildings associated with distinguished New Yorkers involved in the
              arts, sciences, the law, business, education, sports and politics. Includes but is not
              limited to reports, clippings, correspondence, audiovisual materials, printed matter,
              and notes.</p>
            <p>Divided into two subseries, Administrative and General Files and Cultural Medallions.
              Both subseries are arranged chronologically. While files for specific Cultural
              Medallions are arranged chronologically by the approximate date of their installation,
              they may contain research materials or correspondence from dates prior to the date of
              installation. Undated materials are at the end of each subseries. Original folder
              titles have been retained.</p>

          <p>The scrapbooks found in this series were assembled by Barbaralee
            Diamonstein-Spielvogel, and relate primarily to her professional career and interests in
            the arts, architecture, design, community organizations, and historic preservation.
            There are also scrapbooks of more personal interest, with memorabilia from her 1950s
            courtship and wedding to Alan Diamonstein, memorabilia relating to her house in the
            Hamptons, and scrapbooks deriving from her relationships with notable individuals such
            as the Clintons. Added notes accompanying each scrapbook entry describe the contents and
            themes. Scrapbooks vary widely in size from small to large. Items preserved in the
            scrapbooks include photographs, clippings, printed materials, fabric items, memorabilia,
            drawings, cards, correspondence, and notes, selected by Diamonstein-Spielvogel as
            especially significant to a period or to a special event. They were either mounted on
            paper scrapbook pages, or tipped in as loose items among the pages. A few of the volumes
            pertaining to travel consist almost entirely of photographs. For preservation purposes,
            most of the scrapbooks have been disbound by Conservation staff, and the pages and items
            housed in folders in their original order.</p>
          <p>The scrapbooks are arranged in rough chronological order; the numbering sequence was
            assigned by library staff. Numbers 40-48 represent later additions to the
            collection.</p>
          <p>There are several scrapbooks in the Personal Files Series, containing memorabilia from
            Diamonstein-Spielvogel's wedding to Carl Spielvogel, and some photo albums in the
            Photographs Subseries of the same series. In addition, there is a White House Festival
            of the Arts scrapbook from 1965 in the Political Files Series, Johnson administration
            files.</p>
