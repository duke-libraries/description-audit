         <p>The Munford and Ellis families were connected through the marriage of George Wythe
            Munford and Elizabeth Throwgood Ellis in 1838. The earliest papers from the Munford
            family center around William Munford (1775-1825) of the first generation, George Wythe
            Munford (1803-1882) of the second generation, and the children of George Wythe Munford,
            notably Thomas Taylor Munford (1831-1918), Sallie Radford (Munford) Talbott (1841-1930),
            Lucy Munford and Fannie Ellis Munford. Papers of the Ellis family begin with those of
            Charles Ellis, Sr. (1772-1840), Richmond merchant; his wife, Margaret (Nimmo) Ellis
            (1790-1877); and his brother, Powhatan Ellis (1790-1863), jurist, U.S. senator, and

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Family, personal, and business papers of three generations of the Munford and the Ellis
            families of Virginia, connected by the marriage of George Wythe Munford and Elizabeth
            Throwgood Ellis in 1838. The papers contain information on politics, literary efforts,
            social life and customs, economic conditions, and military questions principally in
            nineteenth century Virginia. </p>
         <p>Letters and papers of the Munford family center around William Munford (1775-1825) of
            the first generation, George Wythe Munford (1803-1882) of the second generation, and the

            Radford (Munford) Talbott (1841-1930), Lucy Munford and Fannie Ellis Munford. </p>
         <p>The letters of William Munford (1775-1825) are concerned with some details relative to
            the management of his plantation in Mecklenburg County, Virginia, by an overseer, his
            legal practice in the early 1800s in southside Virginia, accounts of his election to the
            governor's council in 1805, and political questions confronting the council. The
            collection also contains letters concerning possible publication by Thomas Willis White
            of a novel written by Ursula Anna (Munford) Byrd, sister of William Munford. Letters of
            friends and relatives and members of the first generation of Munfords are also included. </p>

            Munford and William W. Hening Reports of Cases argued and determined in the Supreme
            court of appeals of Virginia. Chief of the literary works are two poems, "The Richmond
            Cavalcade" (1798), and its sequel, "The Richmond Feast" (1799), in Hudibrastic verse

            from the coffin of Thomas Jonathan "Stonewall" Jackson in 1863 and from the grave of
            John Ewell Brown Stuart in 1864, and clippings relating to the war. There are also a
            number of letters from two grandsons of George Wythe Munford, Allan Talbott and Ellis
            Talbott, written while touring Europe and while studying at the University of Geneva and
            at the University of Heidelberg, 1886-1889. </p>
         <p>Papers of the Ellis family begin with those of Charles Ellis, Sr. (1772-1840), Richmond
            merchant and partner of John Allan, who was the foster father of Edgar Allan Poe, and of
            his brother, Powhatan Ellis (1790-1863), jurist, U.S. senator, and diplomat. Letters of
            Charles Ellis concern business affairs and personal matters, the latter consisting
            largely of admonitions to his son, James, while a student at the U.S. Military Academy,
            West Point, New York, and of letters written from the springs of western Virginia.
            Letters of Margaret (Nimmo) Ellis (1790-1877), wife of Charles Ellis, Sr., are numerous
            from 1840 to her death and, although generally concerned with family affairs, also
            contain accounts of war activities and social changes resulting from the Civil War.
            Correspondence of Powhatan Ellis concerns national politics; party affiliation of John
            Tyler; the nullification debate in the Senate; Andrew Jackson's stand against South
            Carolina on the nullification issue; the digging of the James River Canal; his duties as
            minister to Mexico; Franklin Pierce's policy towards Cuba; Mississippi politics;
            opposition to Stephen A. Douglas; secession; the Richmond Light Blues; the formation of
            the Confederacy in Mississippi; legal affairs of William Allan; and family and personal
            matters, including visits to Berkeley Springs, Virginia. </p>
         <p>Correspondence of Thomas Harding Ellis (1814-1898), son of Charles and Margaret (Nimmo)
            Ellis, merchant and businessman, relate to his education at the University of Virginia,
            Charlottesville, Virginia, 1831-1832; the <title type="simple" render="italic">Southern
               Literary Messenger</title>; the Richmond Fayette Light Artillery; his interest in
            literary activities; his duties as private secretary to his uncle, Powhatan Ellis, in
            Mexico, 1836, and as first secretary of the legation, 1839-1841; people and events in
            Richmond, 1840-1860; the Civil War, including preparations in Richmond during the
            Peninsular Campaign; labor conditions and financial difficulties in the James River
            Valley after the war; his residence in Chicago, 1871-1883, with detailed accounts of the
            growth of the city and the great fire of 1871; the Republican National Convention of
            1880; clerkships in the Departments of the Interior and the Treasury, 1887-1898; and
            genealogy of the Ellis family. </p>
         <p>Letters and papers of other children of Charles and Margaret (Nimmo) Ellis are also
            included. Letters of James Ellis (1815-1839) in general were written from the U.S.
            Military Academy. One contains a reference at the time of the death of John Allan, Poe's
            foster father, stating that Allan had not "spent his time in a proper way" and making
            some reference to Allan's second wife, which has been thoroughly obliterated. Charles
            Ellis, Jr. (1817-189-), left many business and personal letters, the latter consisting
            largely of family letters and accounts of numerous visits to the springs in western
            Virginia, especially Warm Springs in Bath County, with minute descriptions of
            activities, guests, his ailments, and the young ladies whom he escorted during his long
            life and many sojourns at Warm Springs. Other correspondence concerns the education of
            James West Pegram at Clifton Academy, in Amelia County, Virginia, 1855-1856; John
            Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, 1859; the railroad during the Confederacy, especially the
            Richmond and Petersburg Railroad during the siege of Petersburg; Ellis's efforts to
            remain president of the railroad after the war; and the collapse of the gallery in the
            courtroom of the capitol in Richmond. Correspondence of Powhatan Ellis, Jr. (1829-1906),
            son of Charles Ellis, Sr., major in the Confederate Army, and planter, pertains to his
            activities as a student at the University of Virginia, 1848-1850; as an agent to look
            after family lands in Kentucky; as an officer in the Confederate Army in the western
            theater, with particular references to the surrender of Fort Henry, the Vicksburg
            Campaign, and troop movements and military engagements in Mississippi and Alabama; and
            as a planter in Gloucester County following the Civil War. </p>
         <p>The letters of Jane Shelton (Ellis) Tucker (1820-1901) and her husband, Nathaniel
            Beverley Tucker (1820-1890), relate to their wanderings and his career as a diplomat,
            Confederate agent in France and Canada, residence in England and political maneuverings
            in Washington, residence at Berkeley Springs, West Virginia, financial worries, and
            their frequent changes of residence. Included also are numerous letters of their
            children, especially of Beverley D. Tucker, later bishop of the Protestant Episcopal
            diocese of southern Virginia, and of Margaret Tucker. Numerous letters relative to
            farming operations of Richard S. Ellis (1825-1867) in Buckingham County, Virginia, are
            in the collection. </p>
