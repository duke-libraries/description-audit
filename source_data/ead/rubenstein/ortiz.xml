      <abstract id="aspace_02f465e0aa08161a1139e8f33085ff70">Bobbye Ortiz was a social activist and
        Marxist feminist. The collection consists chiefly of personal correspondence; extensive
        subject files on international political and cultural movements; photographs and slides;
        ephemeral publication material such as grassroots newsletters, pamphlets, broadsides, and
        clippings; cultural artifacts, including buttons and T-shirts; and over 300 sound recordings
        of spoken voice and music (see separate catalog record for sound recordings). The collection
        documents the personal life and career of an international feminist, Marxist activist, and
        mother, who also served as editor of the magazine Monthly Review and was the founder of the
        organization WIRE (Women's International Resource Exchange). English.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The papers of feminist and social activist Bobbye Ortiz span from the years 1919 to 1993,
        with most of the papers being dated between 1950 and 1990. The papers consist chiefly of
        personal correspondence; extensive subject files on international political and cultural
        movements; photographs and slides; ephemeral publication material such as grassroots
        newsletters, pamphlets, broadsides, and clippings; cultural artifacts, including buttons and
        T-shirts; and over 300 sound recordings of spoken voice and music. The collection documents
        the personal life and career of an international feminist, Marxist activist, and mother, who
        also served as editor of the magazine <title type="simple" render="italic">Monthly Review
        </title> and was the founder of the organization WIRE (Women's International Resource
        Exchange). Other personal documents and subject files concern the activities of Bobbye's
        daughter, Viki Ortiz, an activist in her own right. The materials in both women's files are
        especially rich in the history of the international women's liberation movement and other
        revolutionary movements in Europe, Latin America, and other countries during the sixties,
        seventies, and eighties. Many of these materials focus on politics and government in Cuba,
        China, and France. Other topics include Vietnam War protests; students' movements,
        particularly Paris, 1968; indigenous women's movements in Latin America; AIDS activism;
        sexual health; adoption rights; gay and lesbian parenting; and women's issues such as
        reproductive rights, economic status, and violence against women. </p>
      <p> The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> is almost completely CLOSED to
        research; see the inventory below for more information. Most materials in other series,
        however, are open for research.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Personal Files Series </emph>focuses on Ortiz's formal education,
        particularly her coursework at New York University. Other highlights of the series include
        Ortiz's scrapbook from her tour of China, which is further documented by audio tapes and
        photographs in the collection. Writings folders include notes, short articles, and speeches
        written by Ortiz as well as a collection of poetry by Grace Goldin, a friend of Ortiz. Two
        folders contain photocopies of inscriptions from many authors found inside the volumes in
        her personal library (now in the Perkins Library stacks of Duke University). This series is
        partially CLOSED.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Subject Files Series </emph>has been separated into two main
        subseries: one devoted to international women's liberation and one for general topics. In
        the <emph render="bold">International Women's Liberation Subseries, </emph>Ortiz maintained
        extensive files on the status of women and women's liberation campaigns around the world.
        The grassroots organizational publications (many of them ephemeral in nature), news
        clippings, and articles found in the international women's liberation subseries address such
        issues as women's economic status, their roles in the family, violence against women,
        reproductive rights and sexuality, and indigenous women's movements. The most extensive
        segments of the subseries deal with women's liberation in the 1970s and 1980s in Chile,
        Cuba, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Eritrea, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, and the
        United States. The subseries is organized alphabetically by country.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">General Files Subseries </emph>consists mainly of articles, notes,
        and periodicals from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Especially noteworthy are notes and other
        papers related to Ortiz's work as associate editor of the <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Monthly Review, </title>though these provide only a limited glimpse into
        her decades of service there. The subseries also contains materials related to health,
        cancer, and the right-to-die movement; feminism, women's liberation, and the Women's
        International Resource Exchange (WIRE); and the political turmoil of Paris 1968. Together,
        Ortiz's subject files reflect the directions of her activism in the final decades of her
        life.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Photographs and Slides Series </emph> contains portraits of
        individuals and groups, photographs taken during tours of countries and political events,
        and miscellaneous casual snapshots. There are very fine portraits of native peoples taken by
        well-known activist Gertrude Duby Blom. The largest segment of the series documents Ortiz's
        trips to China in 1974 and Latin America (ca. 1984). For related materials, see the <emph
          render="bold">Audio Tapes Series</emph> and the <emph render="bold">Personal Files
          Series</emph>. There are also audio cassettes recorded in Latin America and Nicaragua,
        which may correspond with slides in the Photographs and Slides Series. This series ends with
        photo negatives of an International Women's Day March in 1978. <emph render="bold"> Note:
          This series is restricted. Use copies must be made of any cassettes without use copies
          already made. Please consult with reference staff.</emph>
      </p>
      <p> Posters, buttons, and T-shirts bearing slogans and vivid images were vital components of
        the many social movements in which both Bobbye and Victoria Ortiz participated. The <emph
          render="bold">Cultural Artifacts Series </emph>captures the political use of popular
        culture in the late 20th century by preserving a representative sample of these cultural
        artifacts. The selections reflect Bobbye and Viki's participation in social movements
        concerned with issues such as U.S. imperialism in Latin America, international women's
        liberation, AIDS, and lesbian and gay rights. The series also contains original artwork done
        for Bobbye and Viki, as well as art posters from France. Several oversize posters are
        artifacts from the French worker/student strikes of 1968.</p>
      <p>The majority of tapes in the <emph render="bold">Audio Tapes Series </emph>are cassette
        recordings of tours taken by Bobbye Ortiz during her travels in China and Latin America.
        Additional tapes include recordings of radio programs, interviews, and readings related to
        Bobbye's activism. Descriptive notes on many of the tapes listed below have been included as
        an appendix to this inventory.<emph render="bold"> Note: This series is restricted. Use
          copies must be made of any cassettes without use copies already made. Please consult with
          reference staff.</emph> Related material about these trips may also be found in the <emph
          render="bold">Photographs and Slides Series</emph> and <emph render="bold">Personal Files
          Series</emph>.</p>
      <p>The complete holdings of Bobbye Ortiz's library, which were donated as part of this
        collection and reside in Perkins Library at Duke University, are represented by the
        hand-written <emph render="bold">Index Card Catalog Series. </emph>The hundreds of Monthly
        Review Press publications in the library are one of the few records in the Ortiz Collection
        of her work for over twenty years as associate editor of the <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Monthly Review.</title> The range of topics covered by her library --
        women, Marxism and socialism, literature, Central America, Latin America, Asia, social
        sciences, humanities -- reveals the breadth of her intellectual interests and their intimate
        connections to her political concerns. The catalog is organized by topic, alphabetically by
        author therein. </p>
      <p> The <emph render="bold">Phonograph Records Series </emph>features sound recordings on 33
        1/3, 45, and 78 LPs collected by Bobbye Ortiz during her travels. Hundreds of folk music
        recordings, protest and labor song collections, and miscellaneous spoken word recordings
        date from the 1960s to the 1980s. Recording artists include many well-known musicians as
        well as hundreds of other musicians interested in folk, labor, and protest music; major
        languages represented include Spanish, French, and Italian. Many of these recordings are now
        out of print and difficult to find. <emph render="bold">This series is restricted: use
          copies must be made in order to access the recordings. For assistance, please contact the
          reference staff. </emph>
      </p>
      <p>The addition (Acc.# 2003-0065) consists largely of photographs and negatives (approximately
        550 prints, 120 negatives, and 1 slide, color and black-and-white), documenting Ortiz's
        travels to various locations including Cuba, Nicaragua, China, Mexico, the Dominican
        Republic, and Europe (1968-[1980s]). Also included are publication files related to WIRE
        (Women's International Resource Exchange), a few pieces of correspondence, and other
        miscellaneous personal items. Boxes 2 and 3, containing photographs, correspondence, and
        personal items, are CLOSED to research. Box 1 is open to research. No container list was
        created for this accession.</p>

          <p>Consists chiefly of articles, reports, newsclippings, broadsides, and many ephemeral
            publications such as political newsletters and pamphlets gathered by Bobbye Ortiz
            throughout her life. Materials particularly provide a context for political movements
            and agendas of the sixties, seventies, and eighties. Divided into two subseries:

            <p>Topics concentrate on all issues important to women's liberation movements,
              especially violence against women, economic justice, and women's health issues. Many
              of the publications are ephemeral, prime examples being the grassroots feminist
              newsletters produced in Latin American countries, and the broadsides and pamphlets
              connected with political events such as rallies or protests. After English, Spanish is
              the most common language used in these materials. Organized alphabetically by
              country.</p>

          <p>Begins with snapshots taken in Europe and Mexico which are CLOSED to research. These
            are followed by very fine 8x10 portraits of indigenous people identified as Mexican
            Lacandon, taken by well-known activist Gertrude Duby Blom. Another folder contains
            casual snapshots by Gail Lerner Saharoui, mostly portraying unidentified people, chiefly
            women performing various jobs such as weaving; these were possibly taken in India or the
            Middle East. There are many images documenting Ortiz's trips to China (1974) and Latin
            America (ca. 1984) in the form of photographs and slides. This series ends with photo
            negatives of an International Women's Day March in 1978.</p>
