      <abstract id="aspace_a6afb8a2e48202e921194b548c5ef85d">George P. Garrett (1929-2008) was a
        poet, editor, author, and professor of English. The papers of George P. Garrett span the
        years 1929 to 2000 with the bulk of the material being dated between 1960 and 1990. The
        papers were initially collected and assembled by author, bibliographer, and publisher Stuart
        T. Wright. Wright published a number of Garrett's works at his Palaemon Press and also
        assembled the Stuart Wright Bibliographic Collection of George Garrett (see related
        materials held by the Rubenstein Library). Additional materials were received by the Library
        directly from George Garrett. The papers document Garrett's literary career as an author of
        novels, short stories, poetry, and dramatic works (including filmscripts) and the tremendous
        influence he had as an English professor and an editor on an entire generation of writers,
        particularly in the South. Correspondence with numerous authors, publishers, and educators
        offers much information about the history of 20th-century Southern literature, publishing,
        and literary education. The collection is divided into the Writings Series (with subseries
        of Writings by Garrett, Writings Edited by Garrett, Writings by Others, and Proofs); the
        Correspondence Series (with 5 subseries of alphabetically and chronologically arranged
        correspondence); the Audiovisual Material Series; and the Miscellaneous Papers
        Series.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The papers of George P. Garrett span the years 1929 to 2000 with the bulk of the material
        being dated between 1960 and 1990. The papers were initially collected and assembled by
        author, bibliographer, and publisher Stuart T. Wright. Wright published a number of
        Garrett's works at his Palaemon Press and also assembled the Stuart Wright Bibliographic
        Collection of George Garrett (see related materials held by the Rubenstein Library).
        Additional materials were received by the Library directly from George Garrett.</p>
      <p>The collection primarily documents Garrett's literary career as an author of novels, short
        stories, poetry, and dramatic works (including filmscripts) and the tremendous influence he
        had as an English professor and an editor on an entire generation of writers, particularly
        in the South. Correspondence with numerous authors, publishers, and educators offers much
        information about the history of 20th-century Southern literature, publishing, and literary
        education. The collection is divided into the Writings Series (with subseries of Writings by
        Garrett, Writings Edited by Garrett, Writings by Others, and Proofs); the Correspondence
        Series (with 5 subseries of alphabetically and chronologically arranged correspondence); the
        Audiovisual Material Series; and the Miscellaneous Papers Series.</p>
      <p>The Alphabetical Correspondence Subseries: Group A contains letters from numerous
        contemporary American authors, among them Madison Smartt Bell, who wrote regarding the
        progress of his fiction, his experience with publishers and literary agents, and his
        interview with Garrett for <title type="simple" render="italic">Paris Review;</title> and
        Fred Chappell, whose letters provide commentary on his own works <title type="simple"
          render="italic">The Inkling</title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">Dagon</title>
        as well as praise for Garrett's <title type="simple" render="italic">Death of the
          Fox,</title><title type="simple" render="italic">The Magic Striptease,</title> and <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Welcome to the Medicine Show.</title> The Writings by Others
        Subseries contains Bell's interview with Garrett, in which Garrett discusses his writing
        process, and critical essays by Fred Chappell (including one on Garrett's <title
          type="simple" render="italic">The Stranger in the Mirror</title> and one on the work of
        Sylvia Wilkinson). The Proofs Subseries contains a proof of Reynolds Price's <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Collected Stories,</title> with brief comments by
        Garrett.</p>
      <p>Garrett's own literary career is documented throughout the collection. The Writings by
        Garrett Subseries contains manuscripts, typescripts, notes, and drafts of his work, some of
        it bearing notes for revision. The Chronological Correspondence Subseries contains letters
        in which Garrett wrote about his works in progress and letters from friends and publishers
        regarding his work. The comments of noted literary figures regarding Garrett's work
        frequently appear in letters in the Alphabetical Correspondence Subseries: Group A. This
        series also affords researchers a detailed view of literary criticism and support exchanged
        between Garrett and the many authors represented in the collection. His negotiations with
        publishers are best documented in the Alphabetical Correspondence Subseries: Group B. The
        Audiovisual Material Series contains some recordings of Garrett reading from his own
        work.</p>
      <p>The Audiovisual Material Series, which contains many recordings of Garrett's lectures,
        classes, and addresses to groups of writers, students, and literary scholars, documents
        Garrett's teaching style and his ideas on the teaching of writing. Recordings of lectures
        and readings by many other well-known authors also appear in this series. Garrett's impact
        on his students and fellow authors is again visible in the Writings by Others Subseries,
        which consists of numerous manuscripts, typescripts, and drafts (some bearing notes by
        Garrett) of work sent to Garrett for commentary and revision. </p>
      <p>The addition (Acc. 1998-0356) (5500 items, 15 linear feet; dated 1980-1998 [bulk
        1995-1997]) further documents the life, career, and writing of the author and educator. It
        consists of audiotapes of various authors, including Garrett reading their works; a
        videocassette entitled <title type="simple" render="doublequote">The Great Gatsby</title>;
        printed materials and writings, including published books, journals, drafts, and bound
        proofs; a large amount of personal and business correspondence; and manuscripts submitted to
        Garrett for comment. </p>
      <p>The addition (Acc. 1999-0268) (1 item, 0.3 linear feet; dated [ca. 1996]) consists of a
        photocopied typescript of Garrett's novel <title type="simple" render="italic">The King of
          Babylon Shall Not Come Against You</title> with handwritten annotations.</p>
      <p>The addition (Acc. 1999-0379) (450 items, 0.6 linear feet; dated 1956-1972) is primarily
        comprised of incoming correspondence, chiefly professional; a number of writings are
        interfiled with or attached to letters. Also included are miscellaneous printed materials
        such as brochures and clippings.</p>
      <p>The addition (Acc. 2000-0085) (9100 items, dated 1964-1999) further documents Garrett's
        literary career with additional manuscripts, often parts of or related to <title
          type="simple" render="italic">The King of Babylon Shall not Come Against You.</title>
        There are audiotapes of readings by Garrett and others, literary correspondence, and
        clippings.</p>
      <p>The addition (Acc. 2000-0303) (15 items, 1 linear foot; dated 1995-2000) documents some of
        Garrett's writing process and his direct comments in readings and on videotape. Included are
        page proofs and a revised typescript of <title type="simple" render="italic">The King of
          Babylon Shall Not Come Against You</title>, a revised typescript of <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Entered From the Sun</title>, 11 cassette tapes of readings and lectures
        presumably by Garrett, and a videotape entitled <title type="simple" render="doublequote"
          >Writers - East of the Blue Ridge</title> on which he is interviewed. </p>
      <p>The addition (Acc. 2002-0034) (1 item, 1 lin. ft.; dated 2002) comprises an uncorrected

            <p>Contains publications with pieces by Garrett, some writings by others, reviews of
              Garrett's work, book catalogs, and additional miscellaneous printed items. It appears
              Garrett folded back pages in certain pieces to the page where his writing began or
              where he was written about. Most items were closed and flags were placed to show the
              page where Garrett had marked them.</p>
