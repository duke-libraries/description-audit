      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>William Hillman Shockley (1855-1925) was an American mining engineer and amateur
        photographer and botanist. He was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts and educated at the
        Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Trained as a mining engineer, he first worked in
        Florida and California, then from late 1896 to 1905 traveled to China, Russia, Korea, and
        Australia in search of mining opportunities, chiefly in gold, silver, iron ore, coal,
        copper, and petroleum. While in Nevada and Texas, he also investigated mercury mines. He
        also traveled extensively to investigate mining interests in Perú, Argentina, Chile, Sudan,
        Eritrea, and Egypt, and visited many European cities. </p>
      <p>Shockley married May Bradford, Missouri-born mining surveyor in Nevada and federal deputy
        surveyor of the mineral lands, in London in 1908. After residing in London, the Shockleys
        returned to Nevada in 1913, three years after the birth of their son. After returning to
        London for many years, they eventually settled in Palo Alto, California. William H. Shockley
        died in Los Angeles in 1925, and May Bradford Shockley in 1977. Their only child, William
        B., became known as the inventor of the transistor and won the Nobel Prize for Physics in
        1956.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection contains over 2200 black-and-white images taken by W.H. Shockley during his
        world travels as a mining engineer. Locations include China (including Manchuria), Korea,
        India, Japan, Australia, and Russia (including Siberia), between the years of 1897 and 1909.
        Subjects featured include local citizens and officials, and soldiers; Europeans (including
        businessmen, miners, diplomats, tourists, missionaries); indigenous peoples and their
        communities; mining operations (iron ore, gold, petroleum, and coal); ancient walls and
        forts; religious structures and art; street scenes; remote hamlets and camps; fields,
        rivers, mountains, geological formations, and other landscapes; domestic animals; and
        caravans and other forms of transportation, including railroads. There are many other work
        scenes in addition to mining settings. Other formats in the collection include negatives,
        modern photographic prints, correspondence, and a few artifacts and memorabilia. Shockley
        also documented his experiences in Russia, China, and other places in articles and
        presentations for the mining industry; some are available online (retrieved April 2016).</p>
      <p>The bulk of the collection is made up of 2,227 vintage black-and-white contact prints
        measuring from 2 1/2 x 3 1/2 inches to 4x6 inches, many of which bear original captions in
        Shockley's hand. They are arranged in series by geographical location and date of travel.
        Accompanying these small prints is a small set of larger card-mounted photographs of
        Shockley family members, including Shockley's wife, May Bradford Shockley, and their young
        son William B. Shockley. There are also over 400 original nitrate film and glass plate
        negatives, some of which contain images not found elsewhere in the collection. </p>
      <p>Several hundred modern 8x10 inch prints were made by a photo collector from Shockley's
        original negatives, chiefly of Russia and Siberia; some of these are unique images not found
        among the small original prints, including images of an upper-class family on an
        unidentified estate in England.</p>
      <p>Non-photographic materials consist of Shockley's field notebook from India containing an
        index of photographs he took there; mica mineral samples from India; original envelopes and
        glass plate boxes; and a bound letterbook containing approximately 100 pieces of business
        correspondence and a few pieces of personal correspondence, dating from 1905 to 1922.</p>
      <p>Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</p>

          <p>Images in this large series consist of Beijing city scenes, chiefly taken on the
            street, with a handful of photographs taken in rural areas outside the city limits.
            Photographs in this large series focus on urban subjects, but there are also some images
            taken outside the city of farms and villages. Work scenes show people operating water
            mills, refining salt, making cloisonne, smelting iron, washing quartz gold, fishing from
            boats, and milling wheat. Other scenes feature a funeral procession, an honor guard
            procession, camel trains, ferry boats, city walls, temples and pagodas, a bell tower,
            astronomy instruments, a Christian church, private gardens and parks in Peking, the
            Great Wall, and Buddhist stone carvings. </p>
          <p>People featured include Qing dynasty (Manchu) government officers, Manchu men and
            women, poor people and beggars, wealthy Chinese families, laborers, women in doorways
            (some possibly prostitutes), fortune tellers, and street sellers of incense and herbs.
            Shockley's captions frequently mention social class and conditions, for example noting
            which women had bound feet. Portraits of family groups often include their most prized
            material possessions. There are images of Western businessmen and women, including
            travelers in Shockley's party, and buildings associated with the British legation and
            European businesses, as well as Chinese government buildings. </p>
          <p>There are a few portraits of William Pritchard Morgan, a lawyer, politician, and
            investor in mining concerns, and his family, with whom Shockley seems to have spent
            considerable time visiting and touring; more are found in the Shanghai series.</p>

          <p>The Hebei province in northern China borders Shanxi and Henan, where Shockley also
            traveled, and includes the city of Jehol, now known as Rehe or Chengde, where some of
            these images were taken. Subjects in this small series chiefly consist of temples,
            Buddhist statuary, and a few scenes of groups of men, women, and children taken in a
            mining district.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>Jinchanggouliang (Chin Ch'ang Kou Liang, as spelled by Shockley), is a mountainous
            region in what is now known as Inner Mongolia, north and north-west of Beijing, noted
            for its quartz gold deposits and other minerals. Photographs in this large series depict
            local people, mine workers, women and children, Western men and women, and government
            officials, as well as village scenes, houses, spectators at an outdoor theater, monks
            and temples, and a market square. One sequence documents the induction of a Buddhist
            bishop; another shows Chinese soldiers asking grace from an official and posing for the
            camera. </p>
          <p>Also depicted are landscape features such as the Great Wall, bridges, and rivers. The
            majority of the photographs, however, concern mining operations, with images of gold
            panning and washing, working steam mills, and smelting ore to extract gold, and worker
            housing. Many of the laborers are probably immigrants from Korea as well as other
            regions in China. Shockley appears in several photos: 243, 283, 292, and 349.</p>

          <p>The Manchuria prints form the largest group in the China series, reflecting in part the
            amount of time Shockley spent in this important mining region. Manchuria has a complex
            history of occupation by the Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, and Russians, and is now
            represented by several provinces (Liaoning, Jilin, Inner Mongolia); even today the
            region around the city of Shenyang ("Moukden") is known for its international
            population. Because of this, locations and ethnicities in Shockley's images can be
            difficult to decipher.</p>
          <p>The landscapes of Shockley's Manchuria trip feature mountainous terrain, remote
            mountain valleys, the Yalu river, and cultivated fields. Captions often document
            geological features. Places include the Yalu and Hun Rivers; Liao Yang; Willow
            Palisades; a Manchu emperor's tomb (now in Shenyang's Beiling Park); a Korean house;
            pagodas, shrines, and temples; a Christian church; and a school. Shockley also
            photographed the families of Dr. Westwater, a physician and missionary who resided in
            Liaoyang for many years, and Dr. John Ross, a Scottish Presbyterian physician and
            missionary living in Shenyang. There is also a portrait of Shockley's servant, Kuei To,
            and many images of his travel caravan.</p>
          <p>Travel scenes include boat traffic on a river, gravel and lead mining, an iron furnace,
            a camel train carrying coal, and paying for a fur coat in Shenyang. There are many
            photographs, casual and portrait, of villagers, workers (both Chinese and Korean),
            Korean immigrants of all ages, women nursing babies, Chinese soldiers, French priests,
            and members of Shockley's travel party, as well as the pack animals. There are also
            numerous images of inns where the travelers stayed. Shockley appears in at least one
            image, P-0402, on a horse. </p>
          <p>There are many duplicate prints in this series; as with other series, these are
            indicated by an extension of ".2" after the print identifier.</p>

          <p>Another large series, the Shanghai photographs feature places such as Nanjing Road,
            Longhua Buddhist temple, the Huangpu ("Wong Poo") River and Suzhou Creek ("Soo Chow"),
            and city parks. There are also photographs of places where Westerners congregated: Astor
            House, Union Church, and the Bund (waterfront) where the British Yacht Club and German
            and American consulates were located. </p>
          <p>People portrayed include William Pritchard Morgan, his family, and other Western
            businessmen and engineers whose names are often noted in captions. Also pictured are
            amahs or female servants, Japanese women, Western missionaries, "Jesuit scientists,"
            Indian guards, Sikh police, and a criminal with a yoke. As with other series, Shockley's
            captions often mention details that mark an individual's social status or condition.
            Shockley appears in several photos, including P-590, 591, 603, and 604. </p>
          <p>Commercial sites include a snack shop, restaurant, soup kitchen, ironsmith, carpenter
            shop, photographer, a shop for Westerners, rice shop, and a pharmacy. Vehicles of every
            kind are depicted. There is also an image of a warship on the river (with "USA?" written
            in the caption), and an "opium hulk," and photographs of an elaborate funeral
            procession, an individual wearing traditional opera costume, and other scenes of popular
            life in Shanghai.</p>

            as E. Sabbione, an agent for the Peking syndicate. In one image, a western man poses by
            a sign reading "Jameson and Company Engineers." Landscape features photographed by
            Shockley include loess mountains with cave houses, tuff, limestone, and granite
            formations, and views of the Fen River valley. </p>
          <p>Shockley also photographed mountain villages, stables and dwellings, religious
            buildings and figures of deities, courtyards in the snow, and cultivated fields. Work
            scenes depict laborers planting, fishing with cormorants, making salt, and packing coal
            on mules. He also shot iron furnace operations at Gaoping, Da Yang, and other locations. </p>
          <p>Shockley wrote about the coal fields of Shanxi and other areas in China in several
            articles and presentations; some are available online (retrieved April 2016).</p>

          <p>Typical scenes in these unidentified places include landscapes of mountains, fields,
            and valleys; a few street scenes; men and horses; boats on water; and various factory
            and work scenes, including a water mill. </p>
          <p>One image shows Chinese statesman Li Hongzhang (Li Hung-chang, d. 1901) and various
            dignitaries, including perhaps William Pritchard Morgan. During this period Li was
            governor-general of Zhili province, and in 1899 was acting governor-general of the
            Liangguang provinces, so it is possible this image was taken in one of these places, or
            in Beijing, where Li often conducted diplomatic business.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>These photographs, taken during Shockley's travels through India nearby areas in
            Southern Asia, were chiefly meant to document mica mining operations and laterite mining
            in Nellore, but as always he took many other images during his travels. These feature
            landscapes with fields and rivers; boats on the water; and important temples and other
            tourist landmarks and sights. Two images refer to the "famine works" at Ahmadabad, where
            starving people were sent to be given rations of rice. Animals featured in this series
            include a lynx and cheetah, used for hunting; bats; monkeys; and buffaloes. Locations
            range across North and South India, including Delhi, Agra, Eluru, Nellore, Ahmadabad,
            Tiruchchirāppalli, and Thanjāvūr. There are also images taken in the Singapore
            Botanical Gardens and of the harbors of Penang (Malaysia), and Rangoon (Burma, or
            Myanmar). There are a few images from Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon). </p>
          <p>Of interest are the many images of people: indigenous men, women, and children, often
            with their dwellings or camps; local mine workers; western tourists; and English mine
            supervisors, two of whom are E.H. Sargent and L.L. Wickham. The latter bears a strong
            resemblance to the uniformed man (in his later years), featured along with his family in
            the modern 8x10 inch prints of images taken at an unidentified English estate.</p>
          <p>Among Shockley's personal papers is a small (5.5 x 2.5 inches) black leather-bound
            notebook containing a handwritten index to Shockley's photographs taken in India,
            Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Burma (Myanmar). On the front flyleaf is written,
            "Photographs taken in India in Dec 1899 to Feby 1900 by Wm. H. Shockley." The notebook
            is ruled with red margins, as if for an accounting record book. Index numbers written in
            the right-hand margin correspond with the numbers written on the photographs, followed
            by a description of the subject of the photograph. Some descriptions are more complete
            than others. The notebook is also accompanied by an envelope of small samples of the
            mineral mica collected by Shockley in India.</p>

          <p>Shockley seems to have visited Korea at least twice: during the period of his earlier
            travels in China, 1897-1899, and from May to August, 1902, near present-day Pyonyang,
            where he surveyed the Gwendoline (Ap-unsan) gold mines. He took many photographs of
            remote and mountainous mining districts, taking pictures of country people in their
            dwellings; local and migrant workers; inhabitants and officials in villages he visited.
            There seem to be Japanese officials or soldiers in some images, as well as Europeans and
            their families. As with China, the images of local people show a great variety of dress
            for men and women, and Shockley's captions often refer to the social status conveyed by
            dress, but also to its practical purpose.</p>
          <p>There are also images of fields, mountain landscapes, domestic animals and various
            conveyances, and work scenes such as panning, drilling, surveying, and mining. Many of
            these locations may overlap with what was then known as Manchuria, China; images from
            these regions form one of the largest series found in the collection.</p>
          <p>Shockley also spent some time in Seoul, where he photographed street scenes and tourist
            locations such as the Gyeongbok palace complex, and visited diplomat Sir John Newell
            Jordan; he also traveled to Chemulpo (now Incheon), where he photographed the harbor and
            other local sites, and visited with and photographed businessman and longtime resident
            Walter Townsend and his family, including his Japanese wife and young adopted daughter
            Margaret Townsend.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>During a period roughly from late fall 1901 to May of 1902, Shockley traveled to
            Australia, chiefly to survey the gold mines of Western Australia, especially near
            Wiluna. He photographed numerous large and small mining operations with colorful names,
            many now abandoned; animals and vehicles used in transport, including camels; and
            workers and overseers, chiefly Europeans. In one image, Shockley stands with R. Atwater,
            the manager of the Sons of Gwalia Mine, established circa 1896; the construction of this
            house was commissioned by first mine manager Herbert Hoover, circa 1899. Shockley also
            photographed several aborigine men and one young woman. His images document the harsh
            life in these remote regions, and the beginnings of settlements in the Australian
            outback. On the back of one print he narrates the discovery of a man who nearly died of
            thirst in the bush but was discovered by Shockley's party.</p>
          <p>Shockley also traveled to the central and eastern cities of Bendigo, Brisbane and
            Stanthorpe (Queensland), where he photographed mining company buildings, houses, parks,
            and waterfronts. There are a few images of Perth as well, and of the Japanese steamer
            that he seems to have taken to Australia.</p>
          <p>Modern 8x10 prints were produced in the 2000's from the glass plate negatives; they are
            all copies of original prints in the collection. There is one glass plate negative of a
            nude aboriginal girl that has no print version.</p>

          <p>Locations for these images come from Vladivostok, from which Shockley sailed on the
            steamer "Progress" to Petropavlosk, Gejiga, the Kamchatka Peninsula, and East Cape,
            Siberia, visiting the remote locations featured in these photographs in order to search
            for copper, gold and coal deposits. In addition to surveying for gold and coal, he
            photographed indigenous peoples, thus there are images of individuals and family groups
            he labeled as Chuchkis, Tungus (Evenks), Nivkhs, and Koryaks and their reindeer herds.
            Shockley also photographed European settlers in villages and remote outposts; and the
            crew and captain of the ship "Progress." A fellow adventurer and mining surveyor,
            Vanderlip, eventually published a book, In Search of a Siberian Klondike, using many of
            Shockley's images as illustrations; his narrative, some of which coincides with
            Shockley's itinerary, provides valuable background to the images in the collection.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>In summer of 1904, Shockley traveled to Bogoslovsk (now Karpinsk), a good-sized city in
            the Ural Mountains region, photographing along the route a few scenes in Moscow and
            Perm. Once in Bogoslovsk he documented mining and smelting operations near the city,
            including iron furnaces, iron ore mines, and alluvial (river) gold mining with dredges
            as well as smaller manual operations and "starateli" (freehold) workers. Images include
            city scenes; focusing particularly on a mine manager's house, where he seems to have
            stayed; Russian families he spent time with; servants; mining students; native costumes
            and dress; the nearby railroad station; and the roads on the outskirts of the city.</p>
          <p>He spent many months also traveling in the remote country north and east of Bogoslovsk,
            continuing his documentation of mining operations. Locations include the Lobva, Cackva,
            and Volga rivers, Verkhotur'e, and Kusva. Along the way he photographed railroad stops,
            small settlements, lakes, rivers, and travelers in various conveyances on the road. Many
            of the work scenes in this series also include women laboring as ore sorters and gold
            miners.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>Returning to Bogoslovsk in 1905, also in late summer and early fall, Shockley seems to
            have passed through Alaska or Seattle, Washington, visiting Frank Ballaine, a
            transportation entrepreneur, his brother John Ballaine, and their families, who appear
            in a set of images in this series. He also photographed several scenes in Moscow,
            including the university.</p>
          <p>Shockley stayed in Bogoslovsk, again photographing friends and families there, and then
            traveled very long distances by various means in remote areas of the Urals, passing
            through Nizhnyaya Tura, and the town of Cheli︠a︡binsk. Along the way he documented
            railway stations, small settlements, dwellings and their inhabitants, markets, and
            mining and dredging operations along the Vizhaĭ, Lovza, and Ivdell rivers. There he
            also photographed indigenous Khanty (Ostiaks), ethnic Tatars, and backcountry hunters
            and settlers, often in their camps. There are many images of Shockley's own travel party
            and the troikas, pack animals, and ferries they used in their travels. Only once does he
            refer to the political instability in Russia, where he documented a large group of
            railway strikers "discussing situation."</p>

            <p>Long note on back of print lists names of individuals and families of Ballaine, Fish,
              and Allen. Mentioned in caption is Caption Filsh, "who has promoted Alaska Monorail
              Co. in London." This suggests that the location of this and subsequent images of the
              same family is probably the Ballaine House in Seward, Alaska, completed in 1905 by
              Frank Ballaine, who is in the photograph along with this brother John Ballaine.
              Another possibility is Seattle, where the Ballaines also had a house.</p>

            <p>These 8x10 inch glossy modern copy prints were created from the original glass plate
              negatives. With few exceptions, there are corresponding original prints in the main
              collection series. When there is no original print, the copy print and its entry have
              been added to the original photographs series and given item-level identifiers. There
              are 20 such 8x10 unique images in the Bogoslovsk 1905 series that have been added to
              the end of the original print sequence.</p>

          <p>This small series documents Shockley's travels in late summer and early fall to
            Klyuchi, a remote and cold rural town on the Kamchatka River, where he surveyed and
            assessed gold mining operations. There he photographed the mine manager Harper and his
            family, log buildings at the mining camp, and nearby forests and rivers. There are also
            two views of passenger boarding a steamer near Stretensk, on the Shilka River. A
            sequence of 12 images of a woman and several boys taken in an unidentified park setting
            may not be related to this trip, or may have been taken at the start or end of the
            journey.</p>

          <p>Vintage prints measuring from 3x4 to 4x5 inches chiefly represent images from Capitol
            Hill, Washington, D.C., and locations in southeast Asia such as the island of Celebes
            (Sulawesi, Indonesia) and the Philippines (one image). There is also one image of an
            early London horse-drawn tram, an image taken on board the "Amorita" racing yacht off of
            Montauk, N.Y., and a dredge in an unknown location, possibly in Russia.</p>
          <p>Modern 8x10 inch prints produced from glass plates feature what seems to be an English
            family - man, woman, and three female children - posing and playing games on an English
            estate; the father strongly resembles the Nellore, India mine overseer L.L. Wickham,
            seend in image RL01177-P-1292.</p>

          <p>Series includes a bound volume of roughly 100 carbon copies of correspondence dating
            from 1905 to 1922, written by W. H. Shockley from places such as Paris, France; London,
            England; St. Petersburg, Ivdell, and Bogoslovsk, Russia; Palo Alto, California, and
            Reno, Nevada. The majority of the correspondence relates to Shockley's work as a mining
            engineer, but there are also several personal letters to his wife and friends,
            correspondence relating to personal finances, short drafts of articles on mining in
            Russia, and notes from a correspondence course on the "Training of Children." The volume
            also contains several diary entries from 1922 and notes on the Kluchi mines in Russia.
            Four letters are in German.</p>
          <p>Also in the series is a set of three very small watercolor portraits of unidentified
            women, perhaps painted by Shockley's wife, May Bradford Shockley, who was an
            accomplished artist in addition to being a mining surveyor, an unusual career for a
            woman at the time.</p>
          <p>A manuscript notebook from Shockley's travels in India is housed in this series but
            more fully described in the India Photographs Series.</p>
          <p>Other Shockley family papers, including material relating to May Shockley and the
            Shockley's son, William B. Shockley, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1956
            for his work on transistors, can be found at Stanford University's Special Collections
            Library in California. Photographs of W.H. Shockley and his Nevada family home can be
            found in the Walter F. Shockley Collection at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.</p>

          <p>Series houses an almost complete set of Shockley's nitrate film and glass plate
            negatives from which he made black-and-white contact prints and developing-out prints,
            during his travels and possibly after he arrived back home in London and the U.S. Some
            negatives do not have corresponding prints, and vice versa. The nitrate film negatives
            date from Shockley's later travels in Russia; it's likely they were created from the
            original glass plates when he returned to England, but this has not been verified.</p>
          <p>In the 2000s, a private collector and owner of the negatives created 8x10 inch glossy
            copy prints from the glass plates. A few dozen of these are unique images not found
            among the earlier prints, and are filed at the ends of the original print series to
            which they belong. </p>
          <p>About 20 film negatives reveal experimental images created by Shockley with double
            exposures and other effects; a few of these in print format can be found in the "Other
            Subjects" prints series. </p>
