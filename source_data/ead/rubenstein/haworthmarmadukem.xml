      <abstract id="aspace_a40a2caea295483377d3eed4cf73c1fb">Dr. Marmaduke M. Haworth was born 20
        January 1823 in Guilford County, N.C., and died 23 March 1894 in Franklinville, Randolph
        County, N.C. He served the Franklinville area as a physician. He married Mary McMasters in
        1852 and the couple had three children, Pandora, Viola, and Elizabeth. Collection comprises
        Haworth's medical diary and journal (approximately 156 pages), including his notes on
        treatment of physical ailments and on childbirth in the rural south before and after the
        Civil War. Haworth studied medicine at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia; he
        recorded the purchase of this notebook at Auner's bookstore to be used for his medical notes
        during 1846-1847. At the beginning he listed the titles and prices for the medical reference
        books he purchased. He then recorded 30 pages of remedies and cures, and provided a 4-page
        manuscript index to this material bound in at the back of the volume. He also included notes
        on course instruction (at one point mentioning the lectures of Nathaniel Chapman). The
        balance of the volume is, however, a record of over 750 obstetric deliveries that Haworth
        accomplished during his career, some with full case histories. The organization of the
        notebook is somewhat confused because Haworth stitched in pages with notes written
        longitudinally among the original medical course lecture notes he retained. The obstetric
        entries date from 1846-1894; there are two clippings inserted, one dated 1908.</abstract>
