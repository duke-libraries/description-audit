      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Consumer Reports is a product testing and consumer advocacy nonprofit organization based in
        Yonkers, N.Y., founded in 1936. Esther Peterson (1906-1997) was a leader in consumer, labor
        and women's movements who served as the first Special Assistant to the President for
        Consumer Affairs.</p>
      <p>Born in 1906 in Provo, Utah, Esther Peterson was a leader in the labor movement, women's
        movement, and consumer movement throughout her life.</p>
      <p>Early in her career, Mrs. Peterson taught at Branch Agricultural College in Utah, Winsor
        School in Boston and Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry. Active in the
        labor movement since the 1930s, Mrs. Peterson was Assistant Director of Education of the
        Amalgamated Clothing Workers (1939-1944) and served as the union's representative
        (1945-1948). From 1957-1961 she was the legislative representative of the Industrial Union
        department of the AFL-CIO.</p>
      <p>She held high-level posts under three United States Presidents. John F. Kennedy appointed
        her Director of the Women's Bureau in the Labor Department (1961), Assistant Secretary of
        Labor for Labor Standards (1961-1969), and Executive Vice Chair of the President's
        Commission on the Status of Women (1961-1963). In 1964, Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her the
        first Special Assistant to the President for Consumer Affairs, and Chair of the President's
        Committee on Consumer Interests (1964-1967). She served in this capacity again under
        President Jimmy Carter.</p>
      <p>From 1970-1977, Mrs. Peterson was the Vice President of Consumer Programs and consumer
        advisor to the President of Giant Food Corporation. In the 1970s and 1980s she appeared on
        television and on radio talk shows to speak directly to consumers on current issues.</p>
      <p>In 1984, Peterson was appointed to be the representative to the Economic and Social Council
        (ECOSOC) at the United Nations in New York for the International Organization of Consumers
        Unions (IOCU). In that role, she traveled extensively throughout the United States, Asia,
        South America, Europe, and Africa. She helped secure the passage of the UN Guidelines for
        Consumer Protection and the Consolidated List of Products Whose Consumption and/or Sale Have
        Been Banned, Withdrawn, Severely Restricted or Not Approved by Governments.</p>
      <p>Later in life, she became active on issues related to health care and insurance for elder
        Americans. She was on the Board of Directors of the United Seniors Health Cooperative
        (USHC), and worked with Aetna on "Choice Time," a consumer education publication on
        long-term care for elder Americans. In 1987, Mrs. Peterson became Chairperson of the
        Consumer Insurance Interest Group (CIIG), which worked with the National Association of
        Professional Insurance Agents (PIA) to develop model standards and a "bill of rights" for
        insurance consumers during the liability insurance crisis of the late 1980's.</p>
      <p>Peterson died in 1997, at the age of 91. </p>

          <p>The CIIG/PIA series, along with the Aetna and Health/Insurance series, document
            Peterson's advocacy work on health care and insurance in the 1980s, and reveal her
            personal investment in matters of elder care and aging. Because she was working on
            multiple projects at once, there is some overlap in correspondence, particularly across
            IOCU/UN and CTC files, and across the different health insurance projects.</p>
