      <abstract id="aspace_7ad734ae34ed136ae5c93ccb1c91b008">Economist and faculty member of
        Washington University in Saint Louis, Mo., and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in
        1993. The papers of Douglass C. North date from 1942-2012 and consist chiefly of
        professional correspondence written and received by North, writings by North and other
        colleagues (the largest group), and files on conferences attended by North; there are also
        some teaching materials. The collection documents North's career as an economist and
        professor at Berkeley, University of Washington, Rice University, and Washington University
        (Missouri), and reflects his interests in economics, the economic history of the western
        world, transaction costs, economic development, institutional change, and industrialization
        and technology. Among the correspondents are many noted economists, including Yoram Barzel,
        Robert Bates, Reuven Brenner, Robert Clower, R. H. Coase, Robert Fogel, Robert Haveman,
        Robert Keohane, Simon Kuznets, Deirdre N. McCloskey, Elinor Ostrom, Vernon Smith, T. N.
        Srinivasan, John J. Wallis, and Barry R. Weingast.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The papers of university professor and Nobel Prize-winning economist Douglass C. North span
        the dates 1942-2012, with most of the papers being dated between 1970 and 2012. They consist
        chiefly of professional correspondence written and received by North, writings by North and
        other colleagues, and files on conferences attended by North. There are also materials
        relating to courses he taught. The collection documents North's career as an economist and
        professor at Berkeley, University of Washington, Rice University, and Washington University
        (Missouri), and reflects his interests in economics, the economic history of the western
        world, transaction costs, economic development, institutional change, and industrialization
        and technology. More specifically, the papers document his long-standing interest in
        explaining institutional change and political economies without relying exclusively on
        neo-classical economic theories. His political economy draw him closer to approaches of
        classical political economy.</p>
      <p>Among the correspondents are many noted economists, including Yoram Barzel, Robert Bates,
        Reuven Brenner, Robert Clower, R.H. Coase, Robert Fogel, Robert Haveman, Robert Keohane,
        Simon Kuznets, Deirdre N. McCloskey, Emily Chamlee-Wright, Elinor Ostrom, Vernon Smith, T.N.
        Srinivasan, John J. Wallis and Barry R. Weingast. Some of these correspondents are also
        represented in the Writings Series of this collection, a large group which contains drafts,
        notes, and reprints of writings by North as well as writings by his colleagues.</p>
      <p>North's secretary Fannie Batt is an important factor for a proper understanding of the
        nature of this collection. After receiving the Nobel Prize in 1993, North's correspondence
        expanded substantially. Fannie Batt, his secretary at the Washington University in St.
        Louis, was tasked to take care of the correspondence for North. Her role impacted the
        subsequent arrangement of the collection. Materials are often Fannie Batt's printouts of
        correspondence for North. Most of the correspondence since the 1990s is carried through
        Fannie Batt's email address. Also, North's own responses to emails are not as frequent in
        the collection as one would expect. Existing responses were often dictated by North and
        typed by Fannie Batt.</p>

          <p>Series consists of incoming and some outgoing correspondence spanning many decades, and
            is organized chronologically. Note fields for most entries highlight significant
            correspondents or topics. The early correspondence (1950s to 1980) contains mainly
            departmental correspondence, proposals, conference invitations, and research exchanges,
            especially with departmental colleague and collaborator Morris David Morris at the
            University of Washington. From the 1980s on, files chiefly contain recommendation
            letters, academic appointments, invitations, workshops, proposals, and reports as well
            as other routine academic correspondence. In some cases, manuscripts of book chapters,
            papers or abstracts are attached to correspondence. Prominent correspondents include
            Robert Fogel, Amartya Sen, Vernon Smith, Elinor Ostrom, George Stigler, Oliver E.
            Williamson and Herman Wold. Note that since 1990s, D. North's correspondence was mainly
            conducted by his secretary, Fannie Batt. This series contain files called "Stanford" and
            "Benzonia". Those files and some others are preserved as received by Rubenstein. They
            contain correspondence forwarded by fax to North by his secretary. Since 1990s, North
            used to spend summers in Benzonia and usually spent months from January to March in
            Stanford at the Hoover Institution, doing his research and collaborating there with his
            coauthor Barry R. Weingast.</p>
          <p>Folders are organized by date. For most of the early correspondence, there is one
            folder for each year. In later years, there is mostly one folder for each month. In
            later years North also titled some folders according to a particular subject or
            organization.</p>

          <p>Files document North's active participation in conferences and lectures chiefly from
            the 1960s to 2012. Many of the conference programs concern economic history, economic
            growth, and institutional change. In addition to correspondence and schedules related to
            conference and travel planning, files often contain drafts of lectures given by North or
            notes he took during conference proceedings. Arranged chronologically.</p>

          <p>This series contains select documents on North's academic life and both academic and
            political initiatives. Highlights for his initiatives include a set of North's notes
            from research and consultancy trips to Brazil and Venezuela; North's work for the
            Bradley Foundation, the Task Force on Economic Transition (1997), Microsoft, and the
            U.S. Commission on Civil Rights; his correspondence with the Nobel Prize organization;
            Copenhagen Consensus; and St. Louis Initiative.</p>
          <p>Series also contains North's autobiographical material, his autobiographical sketches,
            versions of his vita from 1987 till 2009, and calendars. For about his last 25 years of
            life, he used to spend his summer and winter holidays with his wife Elisabeth Case in
            their summer house in Benzonia, Michigan.</p>
          <p>Biographical material also contains non-academic aspects of his life. North noted in a
            biographical sketch that research "has been intermingled with a variety of activities
            that have complemented that central preoccupation and enriched my life. I continue to be
            a photographer; I have enjoyed fishing and hunting with a close friend; and have owned
            two ranches, first in northern California and then in the state of Washington. I learned
            to fly an airplane, and had my own airplane during the 1960s. I have always taken
            seriously good food and wine. In addition, music has continued to be an important part
            of my life." This series contains materials documenting his interest in photography, art
            and music.</p>
          <p>This series also contain Fannie Batt's materials including her own correspondence.
            Rubenstein received her material labeled as "Not D. North". Material gives a picture
            into the nature of Fannie Batt's work for D. North, on her other work and on her
            routines. Note that North's correspondence was carried by Fannie Batt since 1990s, and
            mainly through her email address.</p>

          <p>Includes course syllabi, exams, and notes primarily from North's teaching activities at
            Washington University, but also at the Business School in Prague, with which he was
            affiliated for several years in the 1990s. For more than 20 years, John N. Drobak,
            co-taught with North the "Theory of Property Rights" for both economics and law students
            at the Washington University. North was very dedicated to his students. The morning he
            got the call announcing his receipt of the Nobel prize, he postponed media interviews
            until after his regular class. His dedication to students and to young scholars is also
            reflected by the fact that two of his later co-authors worked with North early in their
            careers: John J. Wallis at the University of Washington in late 1970s and Barry R.
            Weingast at the Washington University in St. Louis in 1980s. Arranged
            chronologically.</p>

          <p>Arranged in two subseries: Writings by North, organized by title, and Writings by
            Others, organized alphabetically by the author's last name. Folders contain published
            articles, chapters, reports, drafts of essays and articles, and research notes by North
            and other authors. In some cases, occasional correspondence or revision notes are
            attached to drafts or chapters. Topics include economic development and growth,
            international economic policies, and economic history.</p>
          <p>The series contains more than fifty writings by North, including some early works from
            the 1950s and 1960s on United States economic issues such as industrialization and
            regional economic growth. Large sets of files document the writing and publication of
            North's books: Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance;
            Understanding the Process of Economic Change; Violence and Social Orders: A Conceptual
            Framework for Interpreting Recorded Human History; and the 2008 project called In the
            Shadow of Violence.</p>
