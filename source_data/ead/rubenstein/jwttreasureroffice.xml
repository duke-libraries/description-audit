         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p> Treasurer's Office Records span the years from 1928-1952, although the bulk of the
            material dates from 1928 to the 1940s. The collection documents the financial operations
            of JWT offices around the world and to a lesser extent in the United States. The
            materials consist of correspondence, financial records, and legal documents relating to
            the activities of JWT's Treasurer's Office. Correspondents include Earle Clark
            (Treasurer, 1921-39), Donald C. Foote, (Assistant Treasurer in charge of accounting and
            budgeting in JWT's international operations, 1937-52), Luther O. Lemon (Assistant
            Treasurer and Comptroller, 1937-46; Treasurer, 1946-57), and Sam Meek (Vice President in
            charge of International Operations 1930-64); senior staff members in domestic and
            international offices; JWT's legal counsel; and representatives from numerous financial
            institutions. Multinational clients represented in the International Offices Series are
            the Eastman Kodak Company, the Kellogg Company, the Gillette Company, RCA, and <emph
               render="italic">Reader's Digest</emph>. International offices well-documented include
            those in Antwerp, Berlin, Bombay, Bucharest, London, and Mexico City. Records for many
            of JWT's offices are not included in the Treasurer's Office Records, which indicates
            that the files in their present form may be incomplete.</p>
         <p> The Domestic Offices Series focuses particularly on the New York, Detroit, and San
            Francisco offices. In addition to documenting routine matters relating to budgets,
            billing, and salaries, the records include material relating to the regulation of
            testimonial advertising by the Federal Trade Commission in 1929-1930.</p>
         <p> The International Offices Series documents the complex relationship between the New
            York office and the several foreign offices of the company, especially offices in
            Antwerp, Berlin, Bombay, Bucharest, London, and Mexico City. A primary focus of the
            series is the legal and financial difficulties JWT faced as it attempted to expand
            abroad during a time of rising nationalism in many of the countries in which the company
            had offices. The impact of World War II on JWT especially the Bombay and Paris offices
            is documented, as well as the impact of the 1947 partition of India on JWT operations in
            India. The files also document JWT's efforts in the 1930s to develop radio advertising
            in Mexico, Belgium, and England. The series is divided into the following subseries: JWT
            International Corporation, Antwerp Office, Berlin Office, Bombay Office, Bucharest
            Office, London Office, and Mexico City Office.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
               <p> Chiefly contains the correspondence of JWT Treasurer's Office staff (especially
                  Earle Clark and Luther O. Lemon) with company personnel in other domestic offices,
                  legal counsel, and banking representatives. The series also includes legal
                  documents, memoranda, financial reports, and board meeting minutes. The contents
                  are arranged in alphabetical order by subject, with the subjects falling into
                  three broad categories: files relating to the JWT Advertising Corporation, files
                  relating to JWT domestic offices other than the New York Office, and files
                  relating to general financial matters.</p>
               <p> The JWT Advertising Corporation was a subsidiary of the JWT Company established
                  in 1931 at One Wall Street, New York City, New York, at least partly to facilitate
                  the company's work for clients located in Manhattan's financial district. These
                  files include corporate documents such as minutes, office leases, profit and loss
                  sheets, billings, and tax returns.</p>
               <p>Treasurer's Office files for offices outside New York relate chiefly to San
                  Francisco and Detroit, with the bulk addressing routine questions relating to
                  office expenditures, overhead charges, and billing procedures. These files also
                  contain a memorandum from W. F. Howard to Norman H. Strouse (8-31-49, in <emph
                     render="doublequote">Detroit Office</emph> folder) presenting a detailed case
                  for the installation of air conditioning in the Detroit offices. Records for the
                  payment of several thousands of dollars in club fees for Detroit's managerial
                  staff can be found in the Detroit Office file in the years 1947-1948. Several
                  letters discuss how to handle requests for charitable contributions (Luther O.
                  Lemon to Thelma Hardy, 6-13-49, and Luther O. Lemon to Fred Fidler, 6-17-49, both
                  in the San Francisco Office file; W. F. Howard to Henry C. Flower, 5-25-50, and
                  Norman F. Strouse to Luther O. Lemon, 10-17-50, both in the Detroit Office file;
                  see also <emph render="doublequote">Subscriptions</emph> and <emph
                     render="doublequote">Veterans Guidance in Advertising</emph>).</p>
               <p>Files relating to general financial matters contain documents on a wide variety of
                  topics of interest to the Treasurer's Office. Several folders, for example, are
                  devoted to limiting particular kinds of corporate expenses, such as telegrams and
                  telephone calls. One folder contains information on the New York Disability
                  Benefits Law of 1949 and the company's efforts to comply with the new regulations,
                  while another folder contains documents discussing the Federal Trade Commission's
                  restrictions on the use of testimonials, or <emph render="doublequote">personality
                     advertising.</emph> Yet another folder, titled <emph render="doublequote"
                     >Unions,</emph> contains a published report from the New York Department of
                  Labor ( 1942) determining a minimum recommended salary for women employees, along
                  with an itemized budget that supports the Department's recommendations.</p>

               <p>Chiefly contains correspondence between JWT officers in New York (especially
                  Donald C. Foote and Earle Clark in the Treasurer's Office; and Sam Meek, Vice
                  President in charge of International Operations, 1930-1964) and the managers of
                  the international offices. The series also includes legal documents, board meeting
                  minutes, and financial reports (such as operating budgets, balance sheets, tax
                  assessments, and cash account audits).</p>

               <p>Three broad areas of concern dominate the files: finance, law, and personnel.
                  Financial issues include overdue accounts, currency exchange rates, overhead
                  charges, stock reclassifications, commission rates, conflicts of interest, profits

               <p>Most legal questions revolve around the incorporation of the parent company, JWT
                  International, and the effort to obtain national charters for the various overseas
                  offices--a move calculated to accommodate local clients' growing preference for
                  doing business with an agency chartered locally. In the cases of the Bucharest and
                  Berlin offices, the local agency was sold to national members of the staff because
                  it was impossible to obtain a national charter without JWT directors in New York
                  losing their controlling interest in the local company. The JWT office managers
                  also reported on tax laws, import restrictions and political changes that might
                  affect advertising revenues.</p>

               <p>In the area of personnel, a large portion of correspondence deals with salary and
                  profit-sharing arrangements for high-ranking members of the managerial staff. Also
                  included are disputes regarding expense accounts, Christmas bonuses, transfer
                  requests, home leave, and life insurance. Aside from revealing employee judgments
                  about the fairness of certain company policies, these exchanges also document
                  managers' dissatisfactions with working among people of other ethnic backgrounds
                  and the hardships of life in an alien society (e.g., separation from family,
                  decreased earnings due to unstable currencies, and exposure to tropical
                  illnesses).</p>

                  <p>Most documents in the JWT International Corporation Subseries date from
                     1928-1931, and they relate to the formation of a separate company called JWT
                     International. These items appear to make up Treasurer Earle Clark's personal
                     files, complete with handwritten notes and calculations for a variety of
                     possible terms of incorporation and stock classifications. These files contain
                     several drafts of the Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of the new
                     corporation; correspondence with JWT's New York legal counsel, Breed, Abbot and
                     Morgan; and further correspondence with the various heads of JWT's foreign
                     offices. A 1928 summary of JWT's financial status is also included in the
                     files, apparently because it served as part of the basis for early
                     deliberations about the creation of JWT International.</p>

                  <p>The principal correspondents in Antwerp were Edward E. Pratt, L.R. Deke
                     Coleman, J. H. Cerny, and Rene -P. Jeanneret. The Antwerp file also contains
                     correspondence between Donald Foote and managers of offices in Paris,
                     Amsterdam, and the Hague. Several issues addressed in the correspondence
                     indicate the challenges JWT faced in their overseas operations. For example, an
                     exchange between Donald Foote and J. H. Cerny discusses the financial issues
                     involved in expanding into radio advertising in Antwerp ( 12-5-34, 1-4-35).
                     Also, Jeanneret commented to Foote ( 6-25-35) about the objections Catholic
                     papers raised against advertisements--particularly one that depicted women
                     models wearing pants and exposing navel and thighs. During World War II,
                     Jeanneret and Coleman reported to Sam Meek on conditions in occupied France (
                     7-19-40 and 9-10-40).</p>

                  <p>Fritz Solm served as head of Berlin operations, and the Berlin office files

                     In 1934 Solm agreed to purchase control of the Berlin office, and the bulk of
                     the material concerns that agreement. Delays in the payment process prompted

                     in Solm's dealings with German tax authorities, and to Solm's fears that

                  <p>JWT's operations in India were profitable throughout World War II, but not
                     without many hardships, including Japanese air raids, the threat of

                  <p>The correspondence chiefly concerns JWT's sale of its Bucharest office to local
                     manager, Hratchia Paniguian. JWT's insistence upon payment in United States
                     dollars complicated the transaction because it entailed the violation of
                     Romanian law concerning currency exchange. Also, one of Paniguian's employees,
                     Andre B. Kalman, was forced to leave Romania because of growing anti-Jewish
                     sentiment, and JWT helped to arrange his safe passage (L.R. Coleman's letter to
                     Foote 1-4-38, and the file titled <emph render="doublequote">International

                  <p>The senior staff of the London office consisted of Rae H. Smith, Ed Gordon,
                     L.R. Starkey, and Andrew Sinclair. Because London was JWT's first international
                     office, the company used its arrangements with London to help establish
                     policies for all its overseas operations. Negotiations about profit-sharing and
                     salaries are therefore well-documented.</p>

                  <p>Several other features make the London Office Files distinctive. They include
                     documents regarding the 1946 suicide of the senior manager of the office, Rae
                     Smith, and the company's efforts to purchase his estate's extensive
                     stock-holdings in JWT. One file, labeled <emph render="doublequote">Kodak,
                        1934-1935,</emph> contains a 17-page memo written by a Kodak employee to his
                     superior, attempting to refute allegations that JWT violated the terms of its
                     contract with Kodak. Another file, titled <emph render="doublequote">Recordings
                        in Hollywood, 1937-1938,</emph> relates to legal problems JWT faced in using
                     radio programs and advertisements recorded in the United States for its London
                     operations. Scattered throughout the London Office Files are at least ten
                     letters written by JWT President Stanley Resor--most of them concerning the
                     letter of terms for advertising clients and profit-sharing policies with key
                     London personnel.</p>

                  <p>These files record the opening of the Mexico City office in 1943 under the
                     management of John Kuneau. After three consecutive years of financial losses,
                     he was replaced by Donaldson Thorburn. Kuneau's letters to New York include
                     frequent discussions of international clients such as Gillette, Kellogg's, RCA,
                     and Reader's Digest. Two letters to Foote ( 1-29-44 and 5-10-45) provide
                     profiles of the members of the Mexico City staff, along with comments about
                     economic conditions, client accounts, and advertising strategies (with special
                     attention to radio programs and contests). A letter from Don E. Widlundth to
                     Donaldson Thorburn ( 5-2-46) discusses an experimental run of six one-minute
                     Reader's Digest films. A small glimpse into JWT's corporate culture may be
                     gained from a handwritten letter by a Mrs. Bill Taylor to Sam Meek ( 11-22-47),
                     detailing the hardships her family faced when her husband unexpectedly lost his
                     job in Mexico City. Her outcry prompted JWT to send the family four hundred
                     dollars as compensation for some of their expenses.</p>
