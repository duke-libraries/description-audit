      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The images in this collection were taken by photographer Ron Reis from the 1950s to 1979
        and from 2004 to 2014. The earlier body of work contains 289 black-and-white photographs,
        accompanied by negatives and contact sheets, and consists of documentary images taken by
        Reis during the 1960s and 1970s, primarily in Connecticut, London, and New York City, with a
        smaller number from major European cities. The later body of work contains 3,719 laser
        inkjet prints of black-and-white and color documentary images taken by Reis in the 2000s,
        with a majority of images dated 2012 to 2013. Most of these images are of New York City
        street scenes. </p>
      <p>An avid amateur street photographer influenced by Cartier-Bresson, Helen Levitt, and Louis
        Stettner, Reis focused his camera on street scenes in the United States, Europe, and the
        Middle East during the 1960s, then in the 2000s. Favorite locations chosen by Reis include
        London's Hyde Park Speakers' Corner, Portobello flea market, and Trafalgar Square; New
        York's Bryant Park, Greenwich Village, and Washington Square; and market scenes in
        Connecticut and Jerusalem. Other images portray anti-Vietnam War protests in Bryant Park,
        gay pride and ethnic festivals and parades, amusement parks, and other street scenes. </p>
      <p>The collection is arranged in three series: <emph render="bold">Photographs,
          Negatives</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Manuscript and Print Materials</emph>.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Photographs Series</emph> is divided into two chronological
        subseries: 1954-1979 and 2004-2014. The first subseries contains 289 11x14-inch gelatin
        silver prints, accompanied by negatives and contact sheets. These black-and-white images
        were taken by Reis during the 1960s and 1970s, primarily in Connecticut, London, and New
        York City, with a smaller number from Athens, Barcelona, Como, Dublin, Florence, Jerusalem,
        London, Rome, and Venice. In general, each 8x10-inch contact sheet is followed by selected
        prints from the same roll. The prints and contacts are organized chronologically. </p>
      <p>The second subseries contains 3,719 inkjet prints, both black-and-white and color, the vast
        majority measuring 11x17 inches. The prints, taken between 2004 and 2014, consist mostly of
        New York City street scenes as well as photographs from Reis's trips to Canada, Colorado,
        Connecticut, Vermont, Maine, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and North Carolina.
        These photographs are described at the folder level, with folders containing up to 80
        prints.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Manuscript and Print Materials</emph> include an early curriculum
        vita, some correspondence, exhibition fliers, negative sleeves, articles, and photo
        essays.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Negatives Series</emph> is arranged by year and month, and titles
        were taken from original notes on the negative envelopes. They overlap with the prints in
        the collection to some degree, but there are also negatives present for images that are not
        currently in the collection.</p>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Ron (Ronald E.) Reis began taking photographs as a child with an Argus A2. He shot sports
        photography in junior high school with an Argus C-3 and an Ansco Reflex. He continued
        photographing sports, acquiring cameras, and developing his darkroom skills throughout high
        school. When he moved to Philadelphia in 1953 to attend the University of Pennsylvania, Reis
        turned his 35mm Leica from the sports fields to the streets.</p>
      <p>Influenced by the work of Helen Levitt, Louis Stettner, and Cartier-Bresson, Reis became a
        passionate street photographer, honing his ability to compose and capture photographs on the
        fly. This decisive quality is reflected in his contacts sheets filled with single exposures.
        Reis primarily photographed in New York, Connecticut and Europe during the 1960s. The
        collection captures the look and feel of the 1960s, especially in the cities of New York
        City and London. </p>
      <p>Reis's photographic work has been exhibited at the Worcester Art Museum, Dartmouth College,
        the A.T. Gallery in New Haven Connecticut, the New Britain Museum of American Art, the E.
        Leitz Gallery in New York, and the Image Gallery in New York. In addition, several of his
        prints were exhibited, as the only amateur photographer, in a Christmas show at the Witkin
        Gallery in New York City as well as in a one-man show at Parents Magazine Gallery in New
        York City. His work has been published in <title type="simple" render="italic">Camera
          35</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">Leica Magazine</title>, <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Popular Photography</title>, and <title type="simple"
          render="italic">U.S. Camera</title>. Permanent collections of his images reside at Duke
        University's Rubenstein Library, in the Worcester Art Museum (Worcester, Massachusetts), the
        Museum of American Art in New Britain, Connecticut, and the British Institute of
        Contemporary Arts in London.</p>
      <p>Ronald Reis died in New York City in April 2014.</p>

          <p>These exhibit-quality photographs are in black-and-white as well as in color. The
            earliest are darkroom prints, and are accompanied by contact sheets, while later work
            (after 2004) is most often in digital color and black-and-white inkjet format. They are
            printed in a range of sizes, chiefly 11x14 and 11x17 inches, but there are some also as
            small as 6 3/8 x 9 1/2 inches. The images are arranged by topical or geographical photo
            shoots, in chronological order, with original titles as assigned by Reis.</p>

            <p>This later body of work consists of over 3500 digital inkjet prints, both
              black-and-white and color, the majority of which measure 11x17 inches and are printed
              on Ilford Galerie Smooth Pearl 290gsm paper. They are arranged roughly in order of
              geographical location, with original group titles as assigned by Reis. Subjects focus
              on New York City street scenes, but there are also images from other states Reis
              visited in New England and in western U.S. (Colorado); there is also a set of images
              taken in Canada.</p>

          <p>Series contains 66 envelopes containing 35 mm negatives and 13 envelopes of 120 mm
            negatives; each envelope holds one roll of film cut into strips. Images correspond to
            locales of prints in the collection, including Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York City,
            and various countries in Europe, especially England (London), Greece, and Italy. There
            are also images from a trip to Jerusalem in the 1970s. Also among the images are Vietnam
            protest marches and other demonstrations, as well as early street scenes from urban
            areas and shots taken at an amusement park in Connecticut, "Savin Rock."</p>
          <p>The negatives are arranged chronologically by year and month, and within by location
            and strip letter id, with undated items at the end of the series. Titles are taken from
            notes on the original envelopes. Some negatives represent images not currently among the
            prints or contact sheets.</p>
