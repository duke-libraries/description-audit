      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The records of the Center for Death Penalty Litigation (CDPL) span the years 1953-2020, and
        contain the Center's case files for seventeen inmates on North Carolina's death row during
        the same period: Robert Bacon Jr., David Junior Brown, Frederick Camacho, Willie Ervin
        Fisher, George Earl Goode Jr., Harvey Lee Green Jr., Zane Hill, David Earl Huffstetler,
        Joseph Timothy Keel (the largest case file at 26 boxes), Gary Wayne Long, James Lewis Martin
        Jr., Elton Ozell McLaughlin, Phillip Thomas Robbins Jr., Steve Van McHone, Jimmy McNeill,
        Clinton Cebert Smith, and Norris Carlton Taylor, as well as limited files on other inmates
        and web content from the organization. The Center for Death Penalty Litigation's work often
        involves the investigation of racism and the judicial process, and the treatment of people
        with mental disabilities charged with crimes in North Carolina.[Note: materials in this
        collection may use outdated terms such as "mentally retarded" to refer to people with mental
        disabilities.] Case files typically include some combination of transcripts, affidavits,
        attorney notes, clemency requests, petitions, pleadings, correspondence, motions,
        investigative files, Department of Corrections documents, photographs, audiovisual
        materials, Resource Center files, and in some cases, electronic files. The case files are
        arranged in alphabetical order by the defendant's last name. The Web Series consists of
        crawls of the Center for Death Penalty Litigation website. Acquired as part of the Human
        Rights Archive at Duke University.</p>

            smallest case files at two boxes each are for Camacho and Robbins; the largest are those
            of Keel and McLaughlin, at 26 and 20 boxes respectively. Folder titles below are
            original titles as supplied by CDPL staff, and the original order of the files within

            <head>Legal Terms and Definitions </head>
            <item><emph render="bold">Affidavit</emph>: any written document in which the signer
              swears under oath before a notary public or someone authorized to take oaths (like a
              County Clerk), that the statements in the document are true.</item>
            <item><emph render="bold">Appellant</emph>: the party who appeals a trial court decision
              he/she/it has lost.</item>
            <item><emph render="bold">Appellee</emph>: in some jurisdictions the name used for the
              party who has won at the trial court level, but the loser (appellant) has appealed the
              decision to a higher court. Thus the appellee has to file a response to the legal
              brief filed by the appellant. In many jurisdictions the appellee is called the
              "respondent."</item>
            <item><emph render="bold">Certiorari:</emph> a writ (order) of a higher court to a lower
              court to send all the documents in a case to it so the higher court can review the
              lower court's decision. Certiorari is most commonly used by the U.S. Supreme Court,
              which is selective about which cases it will hear on appeal.</item>
            <item><emph render="bold">En banc</emph>: signifies a decision by the full court of all
              the appeals judges in jurisdictions where there is more than one three- or four-judge
              panel. The larger number sit in judgment when the court feels there is a particularly
              significant issue at stake or when requested by one or both parties to the case and
              agreed to by the court.</item>
            <item><emph render="bold">Habeas corpus</emph>: writ (court order) which directs the law
              enforcement officials (prison administrators, police or sheriff) who have custody of a
              prisoner to appear in court with the prisoner to help the judge determine whether the
              prisoner is lawfully in prison or jail.</item>
            <item><emph render="bold">In forma pauperis</emph>: referring to a party to a lawsuit
              who gets filing fees waived by filing a declaration of lack of funds (has no money to
              pay).</item>
            <item><emph render="bold">Mandamus</emph>: a writ (more modernly called a "writ of
              mandate") which orders a public agency or governmental body to perform an act required
              by law when it has neglected or refused to do so.</item>
            <item><emph render="bold">Motion of appropriate relief</emph>: relief is a generic term
              for all types of benefits which an order or judgment of court can give a party to a
              lawsuit, including money award, injunction, return of property, property title,
              alimony and dozens of other possibilities.</item>
            <item><emph render="bold">Motion of summary judgment</emph>: a written request for a
              judgment in the moving party's favor before a lawsuit goes to trial and based on
              testimony recorded outside court, affidavits (declarations under penalty of perjury),
              depositions, admissions of fact and/or answers to written interrogatories, claiming
              that all factual and legal issues can be decided in the moving party's favor.</item>
            <item><emph render="bold">Subpoena</emph>: a court order requiring a witness to bring
              documents in the possession or under the control of the witness to a certain place at
              a certain time. This subpena must be served personally on the person subpenaed. It is
              a common way to obtain potentially useful evidence, such as documents and business
              records, in the possession of a third party.</item>

            <p>Robert Bacon Jr. and Bonnie Clark were charged with first-degree murder for the
              killing of Clark's husband. Bacon, an African American male, had been dating and
              living together with Bonnie Clark, a white female. At trial, Bacon received the death
              penalty from an all-white jury while Clark was sentenced to life in prison. The jury
              had discussed Bacon's romantic involvement with a white woman in deciding Bacon's
              sentencing. In 1999, a federal district court judge held a hearing and ruled that
              Bacon's lawyers had improperly prepared for his defense. After many hearings and
              reversals, Bacon's execution was set for October 2001. N.C. Governor Michael Easley
              granted Bacon clemency on October 5, 2001 and Bacon was sentenced to life in prison.
              This case file includes videos relating to Bacon's sentencing and clemency plea.</p>

            <p>David Junior Brown was convicted of two counts of first degree murder and sentenced
              to death in 1980. At trial, Brown's lawyers attacked the weaknesses in the State's
              evidence relating to the police investigation and the time of death. Fourteen years
              after Brown was sentenced to death, the State disclosed that the prosecutor had hidden
              evidence of innocence from defense counsel; a witness had seen the victims alive at a
              time that made it virtually impossible for Brown to have committed the crime. At the
              point at which the State disclosed the exculpatory evidence, Brown's case was in
              federal court. The federal courts ruled that Brown could not meet the standard for
              entitlement to habeas relief, and Brown was executed in November 1999.</p>

            <p>Fred Camacho was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in
              Mecklenburg County. The North Carolina Supreme Court reversed his conviction and
              sentence because of the failure of trial to instruct the jury on the lesser-included
              offense of second-degree murder. The prosecution and Camacho entered a plea bargain
              agreement following the reversal, resulting in a sentence less than death.</p>

              attorney did not prepare for the trial adequately and neglected mental health and

            <p>In November 1993, George Earl Goode Jr. was convicted of the 1992 murders of Leon and
              Margaret Batten. Goode was indicted along with two others, Chris Goode, and Eugene
              DeCastro. DeCastro and Chris Goode were also convicted: Chris was sentenced to two
              life sentences, and DeCastro to death. George Goode was sentenced to death as well.
              Upon post-conviction appeals, Goode's defense argued that he had had inadequate legal
              counsel in his original trial; and that his attorneys had not adequately disputed the
              State's blood evidence. Goode's appeals counsel argued that though present, Goode did
              not actually participate in the murders. Moreover, they argued that the State
              misrepresented physical evidence to suggest that there was blood on Goode when there
              was no evidence of such. State Bureau of Investigation agent Duane Deaver, who claimed
              in trial that Goode had had the Battens' blood on him, subsequently came under
              scrutiny for mishandling and misrepresenting physical evidence in multiple criminal
              cases. A federal judge overturned Goode's death sentence in 2010, citing his
              ineffective trial attorneys, and sentenced Goode to two consecutive life
              sentences.</p>

            <p>Harvey Lee Green, Jr. was charged with two counts of murder for the 1983 killings of
              a Bethel, North Carolina store clerk and customer. Green was sentenced to death, but
              the North Carolina Supreme Court ordered a new sentencing hearing because jurors were
              prevented from considering mitigating evidence. Green was resentenced to death in 1992
              and, after a series of failed appeals relating to the exclusion of African Americans
              on the jury, was executed on September 24, 1999.</p>

            <p>Zane Hill was convicted of the January 1990 first-degree murder of his son. Hill's
              lawyers argued that he was acting in self-defense and that the victim was wielding a
              pistol. Hill was sentenced to death and was executed on August 14, 1998.</p>

            <p>David Earl Huffstetler was convicted by a jury in Gaston County, North Carolina, for
              the first degree murder of his mother-in-law. Huffstetler had medical issues, many of
              which were deemed terminal by his physicians. He completed his first set of appeals
              through the state and federal courts, and filed a successor state motion for
              appropriate relief that was pending at the time of his natural death on September 15,
              1995. Huffstetler's case file includes dozens of documentary videos.</p>

            <p>Timothy Keel was convicted of the July 1990 first-degree murder of his father-in-law.
              Keel received the death penalty in part because of his previous conviction for the
              involuntary manslaughter of his infant son. Keel suffred from mental disabilities and
              had brain damage. The defense argued that the full extent of Keel's mental issues was
              not presented to the jury. After a series of appeals and reversals, Timothy Keel was
              executed on November 7, 2003. At 26 boxes, this case file is the largest in this
              collection and includes extensive information regarding Keel's mental health.</p>

            <p>Gary Long was indicted in February 1998 for the first-degree murder of his mother.
              Long was tried capitally and found guilty of first-degree murder on the basis of
              premeditation and deliberation. Following a capital sentencing proceeding, the jury
              recommended a sentence of death. Long's lawyers appealed the decision and on January
              7, 2002 the North Carolina Supreme Court granted the defendant's request for a
              resentencing, citing absence of mitigating evidence at the initial trial. Long was
              resentenced to life in prison without parole on November 11, 2003.</p>

            <p>James Martin was tried and sentenced to death for a double murder in Montgomery
              County, Alabama. His capital-murder conviction and death sentence followed a trial
              proceeding in which the prosecution failed to disclose several pieces of material
              evidence. The Alabama Court of Appeals found that there was a reasonable probability
              that disclosure of the suppressed evidence would have produced a different result at
              Martin's trial. Martin subsequently pled guilty to two counts of murder and was
              sentenced to life in prison.</p>

            <p>Elton McLaughlin and an accomplice, Eddie Carson Robinson, were sentenced to death in
              1985 for killing James Worley as part of a murder-for-hire plot for Sheila Worley,
              James' wife. McLaughlin and Robinson later killed Sheila Worley and her five year-old
              daughter to prevent them from talking to the police. After the North Carolina Supreme
              Court vacated his original death sentence, McLaughlin was resentenced to death in
              1993. He was removed from death row in 2006 following a judge's ruling that he was
              mentally disabled, and therefore ineligible for the death penalty.</p>

            <p>In July 2003 Jimmy McNeill was convicted of the April 2000 murder of his wife,
              Shirley McNeill, and of discharging a weapon into occupied property. McNeill was
              sentenced to death, and to 34 to 50 months for the weapon conviction. In March 2009,
              the NC Superior Court granted McNeill a Motion for Appropriate Relief (MAR) on the
              grounds that a juror had inappropriately sought advice regarding punishment from a
              third party during the sentencing phase. On March 12, 2009 Superior Court Judge
              Richard Doughton vacated the death sentence and ordered a resentencing hearing;
              McNeill was sentenced to life without parole.</p>

            <p>Phillip Robbins was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to
              death in Durham County, North Carolina. One of the convictions was overturned on
              appeal because of a faulty jury instruction. The second conviction was reversed in
              motion for appropriate relief proceedings. He was never retried and in 2002, following
              the passage of legislation to exempt persons with mental disabilities from the death
              penalty, Robbins was adjudicated as mentally disabled and resentenced to life in
              prison.</p>

            <p>Clinton Cebert Smith was convicted on April 7, 1998 of first degree murder for the
              poisoning of his six-year old daughter, Britteny Cotton, and of attempted murder of
              his ex-girlfriend, Silvia Cotton, and Smith and Cotton's two other children, Jamal and
              Breanca. Smith was sentenced to death. In post-conviction appeals, Clinton's counsel
              argued that he had a racially prejudiced jury; that the jury was not properly informed
              regarding lesser charges and lesser sentencing; and that the court allowed evidence
              that should have been disqualified as hearsay. The court rejected these arguments.
              However, in 2008 Superior Court Judge John R. Jolly, Jr. ordered Smith removed from
              death row, finding that he was ineligible for the death penalty by reason of
              intellectual disability.</p>

            <p>On July 10, 1979, a North Carolina jury found Taylor guilty of the murder and armed
              robbery of Mildred Murchison and the kidnapping, armed robbery, and assault with a
              deadly weapon with intent to kill of Malcolm Biles. On July 30, 1979, that same jury
              recommended that Taylor be sentenced to death. The North Carolina Superior Court judge
              then sentenced Taylor to death for Murchison's murder and to consecutive terms of
              imprisonment for the non-capital offenses. For the next fourteen years, Taylor and his
              counsel raised many challenges to his sentence before seeking federal relief. In
              February 2006, Taylor died of a heart attack in prison after serving 26 years, the
              longest of any N.C. inmate on death row.</p>
