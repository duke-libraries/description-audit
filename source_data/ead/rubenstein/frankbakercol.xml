            faculty member at Duke University in history, an expert on Wesleyan Methodism, and a
            rare book and manuscripts collector. The Frank Baker Collection of Wesleyana and British
            Methodism, 1536-1996 and undated, comprises correspondence, writings, local histories,
            printed items, engravings, and many other manuscript materials that date from the
            earliest years of Methodism to its worldwide expansion up to the 20th century. The
            collection includes the correspondence of two of the most important founders of
            Methodism, John and Charles Wesley, as well as correspondence from members of the Wesley
            family. Collection also includes correspondence from many of the key figures in 18th and
            19th century history of British Methodism: Joseph Benson, Jabez Bunting, Adam Clarke,
            Thomas Coke, James Everett, John Fletcher, Mary (Bosanquet) Fletcher, Selina Hastings,
            Countess of Huntingdon, Elizabeth (Ritchie) Mortimer, George Osborn, Hester Ann Rogers,
            Richard Tabraham, and Thomas Wride. Other materials include church records and
            registers, account books, autograph albums, broadsides (notices), circular letters,
            engravings, maps, sermons, scrapbooks, photographs, and memorabilia. Topics covered by
            the materials include the life and training of Methodist clergy; the religious life of
            women; biography and portraiture of Methodists; spirituality; Protestantism in art; and
            the debate between Arminianism and Calvinism in the early church. Organizational history
            in the collection covers several branches of the 18th and 19th century church, including
            Wesleyan Methodism, Primitive Methodism, missions, and missionary societies.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Frank Baker Collection of Wesleyana and British Methodism,
               1536-1996 and undated,</emph> comprises a vast range of original correspondence,
            writings, local histories, printed items, engravings, and many other manuscript
            materials that date from the earliest years of Methodism to its expansion throughout the
            British Empire during the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries. The collection includes
            the correspondence of two of the most important founders of Methodism, John and Charles
            Wesley, as well as correspondence from members of the Wesley family, including Samuel
            Wesley, Sr. (1662-1735), Sarah (Gwynne) Wesley (1726-1822) and the Gwynne family, and
            the children of Charles and Sarah Wesley: Charles Wesley, Junior (1757-1834), Sarah
            (Sally) Wesley (1759-1828), and Samuel Wesley (1766-1837).</p>
         <p>Additionally, correspondence from many of the key figures in 18th and 19th century
            history of British Methodism greatly extends the collection's breadth of coverage. Among
            others, these groups of correspondence include Joseph Benson, Jabez Bunting, Adam
            Clarke, Thomas Coke, James Everett, John Fletcher, Mary (Bosanquet) Fletcher, Selina
            Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, Elizabeth (Ritchie) Mortimer, George Osborn, Hester
            Ann Rogers, Richard Tabraham, and Thomas Wride.</p>
         <p>The collection materials cover many topics, including: the life and training of clergy
            women correspondence and diaries; the religious life of women; biography; portraiture;
            spiritual topics; Protestantism as depicted in art; and the debate between Arminianism
            and Calvinism in the early church. Organizational history in the collection covers
            several branches of the 18th and 19th century church, including Wesleyan Methodism,
            Primitive Methodism, missions, and missionary societies.</p>
         <p>Formats of materials include church records and registers, account books, autograph
            albums, broadsides (notices), circular letters, engravings, maps, sermons, scrapbooks,
            class tickets, photographs, photocopies of original manuscripts, memorabilia, and

               >F. F. Bretherton Papers.</emph> Finally, the <emph render="bold">Small Collections

            <emph render="bold">Provenance of materials:</emph> The provenance of materials in the
            Frank Baker Collection of Wesleyana and British Methodism is both complex and
            incomplete. Baker built his collection over the course of several decades, from a wide
            variety of sources: booksellers, auction houses, historical societies, colleagues, and
            many people who wrote to him about items in their family or personal collections. Where
            possible, such provenance documentation is housed in folders or boxes adjacent to
            holograph items. More often, though, authenticating the full history of an item would
            require broader research in both this collection and the closely-related <emph
               render="bold">Frank Baker Papers.</emph>
         </p>
         <p>Three series in the latter can prove useful for establishing what may be thought of as
            the later history of items (that is, how FB came to acquire them and pass them to Duke):
            the Subject Files, searched by name, place, or topic; Correspondence, particularly prior
            to FB's move from England to the U.S. in 1960; and the Baker Collections Files, which
            contain much correspondence detailing the gradual transfer of FB's collections to the
            Duke University Libraries from 1961 through the early 2000s.</p>
         <p>The early history of items (how they passed from their creators down through the 19th
            and early 20th centuries to FB's immediate source), is more difficult to trace, though
            possible in many instances. Many otherwise obscure or anonymous handwritten notes on
            holographs and early transcriptions in the collection can be traced to one or more of a
            number of historians, writers, and collectors whose lives date from the late 18th
            century all the way to the mid-1950s. More information about all of these men is
            available elsewhere in this finding aid, but their names and dates are given here in
            chronological order: James Everett (1784-1872); Thomas Marriott (1786-1852); George
            Osborn (1808-1891); Lucas Tyernan (1820-1889); George Stampe (1836-1918); Marmaduke
            Riggall (1851-1927); and F. F. Bretherton (1868-1956). Bretherton, whom FB knew well
            from his work in the Wesley Historical Society, is often the most immediate connection
            between FB and the earlier historians and collectors.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="bold">Related collections:</emph> The Frank Baker Collection of Wesleyana
            and British Methodism forms part of a larger group of collections gathered by FB during
            his long career as a collector and scholar. These collections, plus others housed in
            both the Rubenstein Library and the Duke Divinity School Library, contain extensive
            related materials on many of the topics documented in this collection. Rubenstein
            Library collections are listed first, followed by Divinity School collections. <list

                  from his work in the WWEP. Although in theory an entirely separate collection from
                  the WWA, in practice there are numerous overlaps between the collections. The
                  Libraries and Archives Series documents much of FB's correspondence with and
                  visits to libraries around the world, mainly in the 1960s and 1970s, in the effort
                  to document and gather as many Wesley archival and printed materials as possible.
                  The Correspondence Series contains FB's letters to and from many of same
                  correspondents and colleagues who appear in the Wesley Works Archive. And the
                  enormous Subject Files are rich in materials related to the project, especially
                  the numerous indexes of Wesley's letters and other writings to be found in the
                  Card Files Subseries.</item>

                  manuscripts and printed materials used by the WWEP to gather as many as possible
                  of the approximately 4000 editions of Wesley's publications to appear during his

               <p>Documents three generations of the family, but especially the lives of John and
                  Charles Wesley. The series is divided into subseries by family member. The three
                  largest manuscripts subseries are those for John Wesley (1703-1791), Charles
                  Wesley (1707-1788), and Sarah Wesley (1759-1826), the daughter of Charles. The
                     <emph render="bold">John Wesley Papers</emph> are mainly original autograph
                  letters (outgoing and incoming) spanning some fifty-five years of his life. There
                  is also one forgery, several 18th or 19th century handwritten copies, and one
                  engraved facsimile. John's letters contain no one frequent correspondent; the
                     <emph render="bold">Charles Wesley Papers</emph> are dominated by Charles'
                  letters to Samuel Lloyd, a friend and sometime legal and financial advisor in
                  London. These draw a portrait of almost twenty years of their friendship. There
                  are also letters to his wife and children, and to important church figures such as
                  John Fletcher and Joseph Benson.</p>
               <p>The <emph render="bold">Sarah Wesley Letters and Poems,</emph> though little
                  known, constitute one of the highlights of the Wesley Family Papers--Frank Baker
                  thought it the largest collection in the world of her manuscript poems. There are
                  also over forty complete letters and fragments, spanning forty years of her life
                  and including the only marriage proposal she is known to have received.</p>
               <p>The manuscript portion of the series is rounded out by several small groups of
                  letters from other family members related directly to Charles: his wife, Sarah,
                  and her sisters, his two sons, Charles and Samuel; and two grandsons. The series
                  ends with the large <emph render="bold">Wesley Family Portraits Subseries,</emph>
                  some 1000 engraved prints of family members, scenes from their lives, and places
                  associated with them. Almost half of these images are of John Wesley, one of the
                  most frequently-painted portrait subjects of 18th century England.</p>
               <p>Letters and writings of the Wesley family are arranged in subseries by family
                  member, in chronological order by date of birth: <emph render="bold">Samuel
                     Wesley, Sr. (1662-1735); John Wesley (1703-1791); Charles Wesley (1707-1788);
                     Sarah [Gwynne] Wesley (1726-1822); Charles Wesley, Junior (1757-1834); Sarah
                     (Sally) Wesley (1759-1828)</emph>; and <emph render="bold">Samuel Wesley
                     (1766-1837)</emph>.</p>

                  <p>John Wesley and others developed a system of shorthand for communications and
                     writings, some examples of which can be found in this collection. This single
                     undated printed sheet contains a sample of about 20 lines in Wesley's own
                     shorthand - without a key, however - originating from a journal entry from
                     1740. The facing page contains illustrations of ten Methodist Society Tickets
                     from the 18th century.</p>

                  <p>Letters written by John Wesley to family, fellow preachers and members of his
                     congregation. The majority of these letters are abrupt, aimed at answering
                     specific questions or resolving particular concerns, but others are more
                     expansive. The 1735/6 letter, composed as Wesley was on his way to Georgia,
                     relates events of the voyage and singles out General Oglethorpe for praise.
                     Writing to Lord Rowdon on May 18, 1760, Wesley opposes "the simplicity of the
                     Gospel" with "Philosophical Religion."</p>
                  <p>Several letters are either addressed or refer to individuals whose manuscripts
                     appear elsewhere in the Baker Wesleyana Collection, especially John Fletcher,
                     Elizabeth (Ritchie) Mortimer, and Sarah Crosby. The letter to Miss Sparrow of
                     Jan. 14, 1779, first passes on an anecdote that Fletcher told about Voltaire,
                     then goes on to present Wesley's scathing views on the French writer and his
                     successes. On June 3, 1774, writing to Sarah Crosby, Wesley worries that
                     Elizabeth Ritchie might succumb to temptation and instructs Mrs. Crosby to
                     watch over her. And in another letter to her several years later (May 11,
                     1780), he turns his concern to Crosby herself, assuring her that he will keep
                     her writing a secret, burning the originals and transcribing only what he
                     wishes to keep for himself; further, he questions her about her predilection to
                     vices, urging her to speak openly about herself to him, but noting that he does
                     not make a habit of speaking about himself to others so as not to hurt
                     them.</p>

                     <p>Autograph and letter book of Ann Eliza Fourness, Halifax, as inscribed by
                        her inside front cover, 1826. In addition to the JW letter described in
                        chronological sequence above (1788 June 17), it contains inscribed and
                        signed passages and letters from a number of 19th century Methodist
                        preachers. Letters laid in include one from Adam Clarke, 1830 June 22, and
                        two from Jabez Bunting, 1813 Oct. 12 and 1840 Mar. 23. A folder in the box
                        contains photocopies of these and the Wesley letter. Inscriptions and
                        laid-in items appear intermittently throughout the volume.</p>
                     <p>Provenance: There are two information folders about the autograph book, one
                        of which contains correspondence between FB and Hilda Harrison, the
                        descendent of Fourness who sold the book to him in 1975. Harrison also
                        prepared a full list of the contents in her letter of Sept. 21, 1975.</p>

                  <p>Letters written by Charles Wesley to friends, family members, other preachers
                     and members of his congregation. The majority of the letters concern details of
                     Wesley's everyday affairs, including travel arrangements, financial
                     transactions, and assessments of the moral values of various parishioners. Some
                     letters discuss his and others' plans and dealings in America (see letters
                     dated 1754; Feb. 18, 1764; and Jan. 19, 1773). In the letter dated 1773 Jan.
                     19, Wesley discusses his vision for Methodism in response to a suggestion for
                     less preaching.</p>
                  <p>Some twenty letters are addressed to his very close friend Samuel Lloyd, a
                     London lawyer who also handled CW's financial affairs. Prominent within this
                     correspondence is Wesley's growing concern with his own mortality, as well as
                     his thoughts on death in general (see letters to Lloyd spanning the years
                     1760-1769). Writing through his struggle with gout, the partial paralysis of
                     one of his arms, and his wife's bout with a near-fatal illness, Wesley
                     continuously insists on Lloyd's central importance in his heart and mind, and
                     frequently expresses his longing, alternately, to see Lloyd once more in life
                     and to spend eternity with Lloyd in the hereafter. Two letters upon this
                     subject repeat the exclamation "O vain, vain, vain all else!" (Feb. 18, 1764,
                     and Mar. 20, 1769). Arranged in chronological order.</p>

                  <p>Personal letters between Sarah Gwynne Wesley, wife of Charles Wesley
                     (1707-1788), and her friends and family, as well as a Gwynne family tree and
                     other genealogical materials. Two letters see Wesley borrowing money: she asks
                     Mr. Tooth (probably Samuel Tooth, fl.1770-1820) for 10 pounds on March 11,
                     1799, and on Feb. 18, 1811 Robert Thornton writes that he has sent her the same
                     sum per her request. Also included is a 2-sided fragment: the first side is
                     written in Wesley's hand announcing her marriage to Charles Wesley, while the
                     reverse side, written by her son Charles Wesley, Jr., features fragments of
                     scriptural verse, apparently in remembrance of her.</p>
                  <p>RELATED MATERIAL: several letters to Sarah Wesley appear in both the Gwynne
                     Family Subseries, below, and in the William Wilberforce letters, which are
                     arranged in the Correspondence Series. The Wilberforce letters repeatedly
                     address the matter of financial subsistence implied in the letters here--a
                     concern that would last through most of the thirty-eight years Sarah Wesley
                     lived after the death of Charles.</p>

                  <p>Letters, legal documents, and notes of Rebecca Gwynne (d. 1798?) and Elizabeth
                     (Gwynne) Waller, the sisters of Sarah Wesley (1726-1822), and of Thynne H.
                     Gwynne, her cousin. All of the letters here are either to Sarah or between two
                     other members of the Gwynne family rather than to the Wesleys. Rebecca Gwynne's
                     letters mostly provide updates on various people's lives, although her 1770
                     letter to Sarah Wesley gives an eye-witness account of the scene at one of JW's
                     sermons. Miss Waller in the letter of 1770 Nov. 6 is the sister of Rebecca
                     Gwynne and Sarah Wesley. The two letters to Sarah Wesley from her cousin Thynne
                     H. Gwynne concern family deaths. Arranged in chronological order.</p>

                  <p>Personal letters and other documents of the oldest son of Charles Wesley
                     (1707-1788). Letters are to and from family and friends, and discuss daily
                     affairs, travel plans, legal dealings, and family life. The 1820 letter to Dr.
                     Kitchiner discusses the ownership of one of his musical pieces. The 1825 letter
                     from C.L. Wesley is highly critical of Charles Wesley's lax views on corporal
                     punishment, arguing that by censuring those people who would carry out the
                     punishment he becomes an "upholder of crime" himself. Other documents include a
                     Proposal for a Subscription Concert by Messrs Wesley, along with a printed
                     "Scheme of the Performance" attached.</p>

                  <p>Letters and writings of Sarah (Sally) Wesley, daughter of Charles Wesley
                     (1707-1788) and Sarah Gwynne Wesley. Letters are written by and to her family
                     and friends. Letters from M. Doddridge and John Clowes betray great admiration
                     for Sarah Wesley's intellect and wit. Letters from Clowes frequently refer to
                     her apparent rejection of a marriage proposal, while letters from Wesley to
                     Clowes reiterate her desire for independence; many of these letters contain her
                     thoughts on independence and solitude with regard to religious community and
                     piety.</p>
                  <p>The letter dated [1784] April 4, previously attributed to her Sarah Gwynne
                     Wesley, discusses the family's estrangement from her brother Samuel after he
                     joined the Roman Catholic Church. Wesley's 1815 Oct. 12 letter to an
                     unidentified recipient indicates her views on virtue, compassion, and the
                     shortcomings of the female sex. An undated letter to an unnamed recipient in
                     Folder 2 offers her thoughts on proper ways to bury and honor the dead, paying
                     attention to the particulars of scripture on the subject; engages disparagingly
                     "the malevolent Rouchefoucault"; and offers her opinions on the relationship
                     between private property and morality.</p>
                  <p>In several letters Wesley states her opinions about other Christian
                     denominations, including Evangelicals (1819 Aug. 10), as well as Quakers and
                     the Church of England (both in an undated, torn letter in Folder 2); the latter
                     fragment also gives an account of Charles Wesley, Jun.'s meeting with the King
                     and Queen of England. The letter dated [1822] Dec. 29 gives her account of her
                     mother's dying moments. Her undated letter to Mr. Quincy presents her home and
                     family life as unsupportive and unwelcoming, painting the founding family of
                     Methodism as cruel and unsupportive of other religious sects.</p>
                  <p>Wesley's poems, contained in Folder 4, are mostly loose, with two sets
                     hand-sewn and one long poem continuing over ten loose pages. Many poems employ
                     classical forms and themes; other topics include education, women's rights,
                     religion, slavery, and occasional poems commemorating holidays and private
                     events. Most of the poems are signed but not dated; where given, dates range
                     from 1774 to 1782. The subseries also includes a printed copy of the only poem
                     Wesley published during her lifetime, <title type="simple" render="doublequote"
                        >Lines to the Memory of the First Methodist Preachers</title>. The text of
                     this pamphlet edition, 1828, differs from the original 1826 publication in the
                        <title type="simple" render="italic">Wesleyan-Methodist Magazine.</title>
                  </p>
                  <p>Letters and notes are arranged chronologically in three folders: dated letters;
                     undated letters; and undated notes and fragments. Manuscript poems are arranged
                     in four groups in Folder 4: loose manuscripts; Poems, Binder I; Poems, Binder
                     II; and the long poem, "The Elopement," on ten unbound pages. The pamphlet of
                     Wesley's published poem appears in Folder 5. A printed copy of a full title
                     list of the short poems appears in Folder 4.</p>
                  <p>RELATED MATERIAL: The Rubenstein Library also holds a microfilm of Sarah
                     Wesley's letters and poems (film 301) from the Lamplough Collection, made while
                     the collection was on loan at Duke in 1961. This film contains twenty-nine
                     letters from Sarah Wesley, some one hundred to her, and some of her manuscript
                     poems from 1775-1776, including another version of "The Elopement," a long
                     manuscript in the Baker collection. Most if not all of this collection is now
                     at the John Rylands University Library, Manchester, described more fully here:

                  <p>Letters of the youngest son of Charles Wesley (1707-1788). One letter in 1813
                     refers to his child's death after a small pox vaccination. There are two
                     undated letters written by Wesley during a period of failing health. The letter
                     addressed to Mrs. W. divulges details on what he intends to leave his family in
                     his as-yet unwritten will, and comments on what he perceives as the societal
                     corruption brought about by the French Revolution. There is also a manuscript
                     poem to the Earl of Oxford.</p>

                  <p>Letters written by John W. Wesley, son of Samuel Wesley (1766-1837). Both
                     letters to his aunt, Miss Sarah Wesley, concern his growing business and
                     indicate that she offered him assistance in the way of referrals. The letter to
                     Rev. Newton expresses reverence toward his ancestors and a strong belief in the
                     principles of Methodism. There is a fourth item, probably from an original
                     collector, with John Wesley's name and his ancestry, that accompanied two of
                     the letters.</p>

                  <p>Writing from school, Charles Wesley, III, informs his uncle that he has visited
                     with his aunt (presumably Miss Sarah Wesley), has seen the dead body of his
                     master, Mr. Cooper, and has lost three pairs of shoes. On the same page is also
                     a letter by Samuel Wesley to his mother, in which he explains the death of Mr.
                     Cooper, who fell off a horse in an apoplectic fit as he was headed to a
                     friend's funeral. He also indicates that Mr. Cooper had been trying to resolve
                     the shoe theft mentioned by Charles, intending to buy a pair for every boy who
                     had lost shoes out of his own pocket. Wesley observes Charles' low spirits in
                     light of his master's death, and looks forward to taking him away from the
                     school during the next holiday.</p>

                        Frank Baker in 1948. It appears that other materials were mixed in at some
                        point; these have the same general subject matter, though with a separate
                        numbering scheme not reflected in the original index, which is housed in the
                        first box. The second box predominantly consists of these additional

               <p>Series is divided into thirty-six subseries for individuals and four subseries
                  classified by groups. Primarily contains loose letters, letterbooks, broadsides,
                  and other materials sent by and to Methodist ministers and laity from the time of
                  the Wesleys through the 19th century. A significant portion of the material was
                  created by people contemporary to the Wesleys. Some items are in short-hand - a
                  sample of Wesley's own shorthand (without a key, however) is included in an
                  information folder in box WF1.</p>
               <p> The series includes official and personal correspondence, theological discourse,
                  poems, journals, biographies, and notes that reveal daily life among the early
                  British Methodists, the external growth and internal establishment of Wesleyan
                  Methodism, and important controversies in the church at the time, especially the
                  Calvinist-Arminian controversy and arguments over the sacraments and the
                  relationship of Methodism to the Anglican Church. There are also materials
                  referring to ecclesiastical controversies after the death of the Wesleys.</p>
               <p>Other important topics include early Methodist missions; early training
                  institutions; Methodism's relation to church and state; the split with the Church
                  of England; and important debate over women preachers and the role overall of
                  women in the church.</p>

                  <p>Letters and writings of Joseph Benson (1749-1821), Wesleyan Methodist itinerant
                     minister who was twice President of the Conference (1798 and 1810) and editor

                     and Charles Wesley, John and Mary Bosanquet Fletcher, and Selina Hastings,
                     Countess of Huntingdon, but also lived well into the 19th century, witnessing

                     Bunting (1779-1858), four-time President of the Wesleyan Methodist Conference
                     (1820, 1828, 1836 and 1844). Bunting also served terms as either Secretary or
                     Connexional Editor for most of the years from 1814-1827. A strong proponent of
                     centralizing power in the Church, he also provoked much controversy and
                     resistance, particularly the Wesleyan Reform movement and the anonymous "Fly
                     Sheets" of the 1840s, which led to the expulsion of James Everett and two other
                     ministers from the Conference. Arranged in three folders: (1) letters; (2)
                     other documents; and (3) oversize materials.</p>
                  <p>RELATED MATERIAL: Bunting appears at many other places in the collection as

                  <p>Letters, manuscripts, and other documents of Adam Clarke (1762-1832), Wesleyan
                     Methodist minister and three-time President of the Conference (1806, 1814,
                     1822), and of his immediate family. Clarke was a central figure in early
                     Methodism and no stranger to controversy, combating poverty and slavery,
                     supporting more lay involvement (even of women), and holding an adoptionist
                     view of Jesus' sonship. A respected scholar and linguist, Clarke supported
                     foreign missions and the Bible Society.</p>
                  <p>Arranged in seven folders: (1-3) letters of Adam Clarke, chronological; (4)
                     letters of Clarke family, chronological; (5-6) miscellaneous writing and family

                  <p>Letters, writings, and minor legal and financial documents of Thomas Coke
                     (1747-1814), the minister JW named as the first "Superintendent" of the
                     Methodist Church in America (1784). In time the much-traveled Coke became known
                     as "Father of the Methodist Missions" and was later twice President of the
                     Conference (1797 and 1805). Materials consist of autograph manuscripts,
                     transcriptions, and printed materials, and are evenly spread across some
                     thirty-five years of Coke's life, from a couple of years after he joined
                     Methodism to a few months prior to his death. Although most of the documents
                     originate from Coke's time in England, there are frequent allusions to his
                     interest in and travels to such countries as Africa, Ceylon, Germany, India,
                     Nova Scotia, and the United States.</p>
                  <p>Individual documents are arranged in chronological order; following that list,

                     Davyhulme Wesleyan School;" the memoir was composed ca. 1810 and includes an
                     addition by Costerdine's son-in-law, Mr. William Crompton, 1812 May 12, which
                     recounts Costerdine's last days and death. The two oversize items, Edward
                     Slater's 1775 map of the Derby Circuit and the Flixton broadsheet, 1802, may
                     have belonged to Costerdine at one time according the provenance information
                     provided.</p>
                  <p>Included is a photocopy of a letter to Baker from Alfred Hopwood, ca. 1944,
                     explaining provenance for Costerdine items.</p>
                  <p>Also included is an 1827 letter with a "Wesley Seal," multiple letters from the
                     beginning of the 20th century discussing early Methodist items (Stampe letter
                     includes short bio of Kershaw), and a copy of the Methodist publication <title
                        type="simple" render="doublequote">Daybreak</title>. These items do not seem
                     to be related to Costerdine.</p>

                  <p>Letters, addresses, and writings of Joseph Entwisle (1767-1841), who was twice
                     elected President of the Conference (1812, 1825) and later appointed first
                     house governor of the Hoxton Theological Institution. This latter appointment,
                     to govern the first organization for formal training of Wesleyan Methodist
                     ministers, is the source of two of the longest manuscripts here, <title
                        type="simple" render="doublequote">Hints for Conversation with the Students
                        of the Wesleyan Theological Institution, Hoxton</title> (1834), and the 1838
                        <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Address to the Students.</title>
                     One manuscript essay, <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Thoughts on
                        Methodism--Primitive and Modern</title> (1797), was later incorporated into
                     Entwisle's memoir and became an important early contribution to Methodist
                     historiography. Entwisle's letters are distributed intermittently across some
                     three decades of his life. In his 1822 letter to Ashworth, Entwisle briefly
                     discusses and copies the whole of William Grimshaw's Covenant with God,
                     1754.</p>
                  <p>RELATED MATERIAL: materials by and about Joseph Entwisle appear in several
                     other series in the collection. See especially the following: Printed Materials
                     Series; Volumes Series, Letter Books Subseries and Writings Subseries; and the
                     separately cataloged small collection, Perronet Family Papers. For a long
                     letter to Entwisle from the missionary John Felvus, about 1820s conflict in
                     Barbados, see the Subjects Series, Caribbean and Latin America.</p>

                  <p>Letters, will, notebooks, and notes of John William Fletcher (1729-1785), a
                     Church of England clergyman and Methodist writer. He resisted Wesley's attempts
                     to persuade him to itinerate, and he worked hard (with Joseph Benson) to keep
                     the Methodist movement within the Church of England. He wrote extensively and
                     was the main exponent of Arminian theology. Relatively late in life, he married
                     Mary Bosanquet, who served as his partner in ministry until his death.</p>
                  <p>Arranged in three folders: (1) series of letters to Joseph Benson regarding
                     Calvinist controversy surrounding Lady Huntingdon's school at Trevecca; (2)
                     individual letters in chronological order; (3) other documents. </p>
                  <p>RELATED MATERIAL: Letters from or to John Fletcher also appear in the Wesley
                     Family Series, Charles Wesley Subseries; in the Correspondence Series, Mrs.
                     Leighton Letter Book; and in the Perronet Family Papers. FB's research on the
                     letters and portraits of Fletcher appear in the Frank Baker Papers, Subject
                     Files, Alphabetical Subseries I. Additionally, the Rubenstein Library holds
                     some 140 editions of monographs by or about Fletcher.</p>

                  <p>Letters and other papers of Mary (Bosanquet) Fletcher (1739-1815), Methodist
                     preacher and wife of John Fletcher. In 1762 she went to live in her own house
                     in Leytonstone where, with Sarah Crosby and Sarah Ryan, she established a
                     Christian community caring for needy children and began 'to exhort, and to read
                     and expound the scriptures.' Wesley did not agree to let her itinerate, but he
                     did acknowledge that she had an 'extra-ordinary call.' She married John
                     Fletcher in 1781 and joined in his ministry, which she effectively continued
                     after his death.</p>

                  <p>Letters of Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon (1707-1791). Lady Huntingdon
                     was linked to the Wesleys and the Methodist movement for most of the first
                     half-century of its existence. She lived a life of great contradictions and
                     changes of heart: an ardent early supporter of JW, she finally broke with him
                     and established her own Connexion, which still exists today in England and
                     Sierra Leone; she sent great amounts of money to fund the purchase of slaves
                     for a project in Georgia, but only three years later became the patroness of
                     Phillis Wheatley, arranging the publication of her first book of poetry, which
                     Wheatley dedicated to Huntingdon.</p>

                     Collection includes an invitation to dinner for the Universal Medical
                     Institution, of which Hutchison is listed as a Steward; on the back of this is
                     a four-week calendar with four columns of daily preaching engagements. Formal
                     invitation card from Mr. Allan to dinner with Mr. Butterworth includes the
                     original envelope with heavy black wax seal. Mrs. Greene included an engraved
                     tradesman's card for "Stannard &amp; England..." with her address handwritten
                     on back. There is a formal letter from Mrs. Hutchison donating Wesleyan relics
                     to the President of the conference, in which letter she emphasizes her Moravian
                     roots.</p>

                     <p>Holograph letters, including one from to James Everett, Manchester, 1827
                        June 11, in which Jackson regrets that he cannot currently publish Everett's
                        history of Manchester Methodism due to the fact that the July and August
                        magazines have already been put to press. Jackson sometimes alludes to his
                        writing: in a letter of Jan. 1, 1855, he mentions finishing the rough draft
                        of his life of "the late Dr. [Robert] Newton." In a lengthy letter of Sept.
                        28 1869 to Mrs. [Smallpage?], he recalls what he knew of her father, Mr.
                        Keeling, whom he first met in 1815. In a letter to Dr. Osborn, Oct. 11 1871,
                        he praises Osborn's upcoming series of articles that effectively refute the
                        writing of Tyernan and his interpretations of Wesley's life and other facts
                        of Methodist history.</p>

                  <p>Disbound letter book of a Mrs. Leighton of The Vineyards, Bath. Little
                     information has been found about Mrs. Leighton herself, but some of FB's notes
                     refer to her as "Mrs. Knyvett Leighton, friend and disciple of Lady Huntingdon"
                     (see Frank Baker Papers, Subject Files, John Fletcher). Her husband was at one
                     time an agent of the Countess. The collection consists entirely of letters to
                     Leighton from various well-known figures in 18th-century Methodism, especially
                     Huntingdon, whose letters comprise about half the collection. Other
                     correspondents include John Fletcher and George Whitefield, represented
                     elsewhere in the Baker Wesleyana collection; Henry Venn, an Anglican vicar;
                     Martin Madan, also an Anglican clergyman; and Madan's daughter, Penelope

                  <p>Letters to and from Henry Moore (1751-1844), Wesleyan Minister. He became an
                     itinerant in 1779 and later served as John Wesley's traveling companion and
                     amanuensis (1784-86). Moore was one of three preachers ordained by Wesley for
                     work in England, and he was present at Wesley's death. He served as president
                     of the conference in 1804 and 1823. The letters here are brief notes, but the
                     broadsheet is a copy of the 1794 resolution from the Bristol trustees barring
                     Moore from preaching at the New Room and Guinea Street Chapel in response to
                     his celebration of Holy Communion there. This copy is addressed by Moore to
                     Benson (in Manchester). </p>
                  <p>This file also contains double-sided pages 2 through 10 (4 sheets, total) of
                     what appears to be a sermon or other religious text composed in Moore's
                     handwriting and dated "Bath, Nov. 19th 1793." Page 1, which presumably would
                     include an intended recipient, is missing as of July 2018.</p>
                  <p>RELATED MATERIAL: another broadsheet from August 1794, also with a long letter
                     from Moore to Benson, appears in the Joseph Benson Papers, and Moore is the
                     author or subject of numerous broadsheets and circular letters in the Printed
                     Materials Series. Several letters from and to Moore appear in letter books
                     Simpson A, WP I and II, Perronet, and Steele. Other related materials in the
                     Rubenstein Library include the <extref

                  <p>Letters of Elizabeth Ritchie, later Elizabeth Mortimer, (1754-1835); mostly
                     contemporary copies or drafts, rather than originals, many of them heavily
                     edited. The core of the collection are the young Ritchie's letters to JW, in
                     which she expresses great emotional attachment to the preacher. Her
                     correspondence with JW from the 1770s vividly details her many bodily
                     afflictions and the treatments she has undergone to cure them. She likewise
                     details the illnesses of and treatments incurred by her friends. Beginning in
                     1779, as she begins to see many of her friends pass away, Ritchie becomes
                     increasingly preoccupied with death and the afterlife. Autograph letters from
                     the 1790s-1810s depict her burgeoning friendship with Sarah (Sally) Wesley,
                     with whom she discusses matters both spiritual and mundane. And finally, a
                     printed item from 1835--the year after Mortimer's death--transcribes an
                     additional fifty letters, 1776-1809, written to a wide array of
                     correspondents.</p>

                  <p>Three letters by Rev. John Newton (1725-1807), a slave trader who became an
                     Anglican priest and hymn writer, eventually came to regret his involvement in
                     slavery, and late in life supported abolitionist William Wilberforce. He was
                     influenced by John Wesley and George Whitefield, and his evangelical preaching
                     navigated a middle way between Arminianism and Calvinism. He also collaborated
                     with poet William Cowper on a volume of hymns; his own best-known hymn today is

                  <p>Letters and journal extract of Hester Ann (Roe) Rogers (1756-1794). The
                     daughter of an Anglican clergyman, Roe was moved by the preaching of David
                     Simpson and Samuel Bardsley and converted to Methodism in 1774 over her
                     family's objections. She went on to strike up a lifelong correspondence with
                     John Wesley after first meeting him in 1776, and with his encouragement became
                     well-known as a Methodist spiritual writer. The letters here consist mainly of
                     numbered copies or drafts addressed to Miss Ann Loxdale. They are spiritual in
                     nature, frequently discussing the topic of God's eternal love; she cautions
                     Loxdale against reading mystic authors, recounts a theological discussion
                     between herself and Mr. [John] Fletcher; and discusses the Methodist revival
                     occurring in Dublin (1784). The letter of 1787 July 13 signed by James and
                     Hester Rogers cites a prayer given by JW as affirmation of God's love. </p>

                     <emph render="bold">Provenance:</emph> though presented as either originals or
                     contemporary copies, the letters to Ann Loxdale were copied several years after
                     the death of Rogers in 1794. Several letters bear a watermark of 1805, another
                     1801.</p>
                  <p>RELATED MATERIAL: Housed separately, in the John Steele Letter Book (see
                     Volumes Series), are transcribed extracts from Rogers's journal dated 1782 Mar.
                     29 - Apr. 1. Here she gives accounts of sermons delivered by JW and also
                     continues to ruminate on the notion of divine love. Also in the Volumes Series
                     is the commonplace book of her husband, James Rogers, which in its final pages
                     records a eulogistic poem upon Hester's death, written by a female friend. The

                        following letter. Baker's notes: 12 pp., answering various queries about
                        history of early Meth[odis]m, for Sandwith: e.g. Sacrament controversy, and
                        separation of Wm. Moore in 1785 on this account; 'Mr.J.Wesley mildly
                        recommended the people to go to the church and Sacraments -- Mr. C. Wesley
                        threatened them with Damnation if they did not.' (p.2). 'it was not our
                        Societies who held the high-church opinions -- but the Preachers'. Praises
                        the extent Methodists go to evangelize the unchurched: "never had been done
                        before since the apostolic age." Clarke approved Plan of Pacification. Ref.

                        deceased. Then follows a poem addressed to "Betsy" (possibly Simpson's
                        daughter), which advises her to beware of the false intentions of the young
                        men who court her and to make sure that she chooses a man whose love is

                  <p>Letters to Tabraham from T. Percival Bunting, Thomas Vasey, and others. Series
                     of letters from Sarah and Richard Goodman, Jemima Yaxley, and Tabraham
                     regarding controversy at Sedgeford surrounding Yaxley (regarding authority in
                     the church and expelled preachers--Yaxley is possibly referring to Primitive
                     Methodists at one point, though this is unclear). Letters from Bunting and
                     Hameston about controversy surrounding Hameston, who resigns. Two letters from
                     A. Cannell criticizing Methodist Trustees' meeting. Series of form letters.

                  <p>Letters from, to, and about itinerant preacher Zechariah Taft (1772-1848) and
                     Mary Barritt (1772-1851), later Mary Taft. Although there are no letters by
                     Barritt here, and only one directly addressed to her, her preaching is a
                     frequently-broached topic. Taft's correspondents also refer to his well-known
                     wife. In 1802, the year of their marriage, Laurence Kane writes to inquire
                     about rumors of controversy: "Various accounts having reached us here,
                     respecting your good wife's preaching, and Mr. [Joseph] Benson's interference
                     there with." Three decades later, letters continue to include invitations to
                     both of them to preach. In another, Taft himself mentions to John Bramwell Mrs.
                     Taft's recent work in the Newark Circuit and reiterates his continuing interest
                     in women's preaching: "We should also like to know ... whether Mrs. Ward
                     (Wood?)--or any other pious female of your acquaintance acts publickly for
                     God." Other topics include overseas missions. On an early letter from William
                     Ault, who would go on to accompany Thomas Coke on a fateful voyage to establish
                     Methodist missions in Ceylon, Taft later recorded the brief note that "Mr. Ault
                     died at Celon." And in an 1845 letter he reminds George John Stevenson of the
                     Methodist contribution to the anti-slavery movement: "The africans in the West
                     Indies would have been in slavery this day had not the subject been agitated in
                     this Country."</p>

                  <p>Apparently the papers of two different men named Thomas Vasey whose
                     relationship, if any, is unclear. The earliest documents here (1794, 1826)
                     probably relate to the Thomas Vasey (1746-1826) who became one of the founders
                     of American Methodism; he was ordained as deacon and elder by JW in 1784 and
                     sent to America with Thomas Coke and Richard Whatcoat, where he stayed two
                     years. The broadside, 1794, pertains to a controversy in which trustees
                     dismissed preachers and banned them from chapels even though they were
                     appointed there by preachers in connection. The later documents here are the
                     letters of a 19th century minister, Thomas Vasey (1814-1871). The letters to
                     Richard Tabraham pertain to various controversies, including one about the
                     prosecution of unlawful ministers in Methodist chapels.</p>

                  <p>Correspondence of Richard Watson (1781-1833), Wesleyan Methodist minister,
                     theologian, and president of the conference in 1826. Watson was an important
                     early advocate for Wesleyan missions, and this topic comes up frequently in his
                     correspondence, especially in reference to the West Indies, India, and South
                     Africa. Letters to Jabez Bunting, Henry Moore, Thomas Jackson, John Felvus, and
                     others. Several letters to and about Moore referencing a mid-1820s controversy.
                     Letter to Felvus, 1831, references a slave insurrection in Antigua, presumably
                     a different one than that desc. in Felvus's long letter to Entwisle, 1824
                     Letters to John Furness (broadside on Methodist Missions), Thomas Galland,
                     Robert Pilter, William Threlfall (missionary in Africa). Correspondence
                     consists of nine autograph manuscripts, listed individually, and seventeen FB
                     transcriptions, summarized at the end.</p>

                  <p>Letters, writings, printed materials, and other documents of Francis Athow West
                     (1801-1869), Wesleyan Methodist minister, President of the Conference in 1857,
                     and Governor of the Kingswood School from 1862-1867. His correspondence to
                     George Osborn comprises by far the largest portion of these materials; they are
                     mostly routine, friendly letters about mundane issues in the Church, books, and
                     family. Other correspondence includes letters to his wife, son, and other
                     family members; and correspondence with various colleagues in the Church.
                     Various writings, in manuscript and print, and other materials are gathered in
                     the final folder, as detailed below. Arranged in four groups: letters to
                     Osborn; letters to family; letters to others; and other materials.</p>
                  <p>RELATED MATERIAL: A manuscript volume of sermons, attributed by FB to West, can
                     be found in the Volumes Series, Writings and Addresses Subseries.</p>

                  <p>Letters and other documents of William Wilberforce (1759-1833), Minister of
                     Parliament and slavery abolitionist. Wilberforce's long association with the
                     Wesley family began in the 1780s. After Charles Wesley's death in 1788, he
                     served as administrator of a pension for the widowed Sarah (who survived
                     another 36 years). Most famously, the dying John Wesley wrote his last recorded
                     letter to Wilberforce, urging him to continue his fight to abolish the slave
                     trade (<extref

                     materials here are arranged in two folders. Folder 1 consists of letters from
                     Wilberforce to the family of Charles Wesley, mainly about his administration of
                     their annuity; these are not originals but early transcriptions of eight
                     letters, on three sheets, probably made by Thomas Marriott (1786-1852). Folder
                     2 consists of holograph items, including the original of Wilberforce's Aug. 29,
                     1792 letter to Mrs. Sarah Wesley.</p>

                  <p>Letter books, autobiography, and other writings of Thomas Wride (1733-1807), an
                     early Methodist itinerant. Wride was stationed in Devon and other areas, being
                     moved several times by JW due to his conflicts with other preachers. His papers
                     consist of six pamphlet-size volumes and several loose sheets of manuscript,
                     with copies of his own letters being the most prominent content. Several
                     letters to the Wesley brothers, usually John, appear in at least three volumes.
                     Other writings include Wride's autobiography and a narrative about the
                     conversion and visionary dream of an unnamed woman. Loose items are listed

                     from several notes on them by the historian Luke Tyernan, circa 1863. In most
                     cases Tyernan has added a blue paper binder, supplied and titled, stated that
                     he bought the manuscripts from James Everett, and that the writing is in the
                     hand of Wride. How the volumes eventually came to Baker is unknown. Unmentioned
                     in either his original sale to Duke in 1961 or in any later accession, they
                     were found loose among his papers in 2010.</p>

                     <p>Anecdotes about the history of the Methodist church in Rochdale, many of
                        which are stories that the writer's grandmother passed on to him. Found with
                        the Thomas Wride material but unrelated to it, aside from the general topic
                        of local histories.</p>
                     <p>POSSIBLY RELATED MATERIAL: It is unestablished whether Scholfield's stories
                        are about the same Rochdale Methodist preaching house whose 1770 founding
                        licence is housed in the Subject Files--see Dissenters.</p>

                        Cooper which he sent to Charlesworth. Letter criticizes Cooper for writing
                        an inflammatory letter to a Methodist minister, shows Cooper his hypocrisy,
                        and accuses him of secretly hating Methodism.</p>

                           at Mr. Riggall's request. 1849 letter defends the expulsion of Everett,
                           Dunn, and Griffith; writer argues that they were expelled not for
                           expressing their opinion, but for breaking Methodist law; also defends
                           the "high" price of Methodist books (where the money goes, etc.). Levick

                     <p>Letters and documents from and about John Pawson (1737-1806), who entered
                        itinerant ministry in 1762 and was then ordained by John Wesley for work in
                        Scotland in 1785. He was involved in many Methodist controversies,
                        especially after Wesley's death, some of which are alluded to in the
                        letters. Burton provides an extensive account of Pawson's efforts to "die
                        well" in his last weeks; Buckley sends condolences on his death and
                        ruminates on the afterlife.</p>

                     invitations. A frequent topic is the Education Fund. F. F. Bretherton's name
                     also appears frequently, and he was likely Baker's immediate source for some of
                     these letters. Certain longer and older letters, circa 1775-1825, have been
                     transferred to various subseries in the Correspondence Series, particularly to
                     James Everett. Arranged alphabetically to folder level.</p>

                  <p>These materials, received as a discrete alphabetical file in the Frank Baker
                     Papers, were transferred to the Frank Baker Collection of Wesleyana and British
                     Methodism because of many of the Presidents' direct connections with many of
                     the historical figures in the main body of the Correspondence Series. The file
                     came with a brief checklist of Wesleyan Methodist Conference and Methodist
                     Conference Presidents and other information about the history of this office.

                  <p>Small collection of correspondence without provenance, discovered loose amongst
                     Baker's papers. The bulk appears to be correspondence Baker inherited (by gift
                     or purchase) from earlier collectors of Wesleyana and Methodist manuscripts
                     active in the late 19th to early 20th centuries, especially John Austen and G.
                     B. Cocking. In addition to correspondence directly to or from Austen and
                     Cocking, there are numerous letters from late 19th century Methodist preachers
                     and Wesleyan presidents, so that there is some overlap in content with the two
                     subseries immediately preceding this one. Arranged chronologically, by decade,
                     with the exception of the folder of Presidents' Letters described below.</p>

               <p>Consists mainly of albums of Methodist class and band tickets; also contains many
                  loose tickets and groups of Methodist class papers and books; and research
                  material on these and related topics. The "class meeting" and "class ticket" refer
                  back to the earliest years of Wesley's Methodist societies, with the class paper
                  introduced to record attendance at the meetings and the class tickets distributed
                  to members quarterly. The series contains more than 4000 tickets, most of them
                  mounted in albums or scrapbooks. The volumes vary greatly in size and physical
                  condition, from booklets scarcely larger than the tickets themselves (about 2" x
                  3"), to large scrapbooks with many items coming loose, to such
                  beautifully-preserved albums as the Joseph G. Wright Class and Band Tickets,
                  1742-1954.</p>
               <p>Though mainly from English churches, there are also multiple examples from other
                  countries, including tickets printed in Welsh, German, and Tamil. In addition to
                  the Wesleyan Methodist church, several other denominations are represented,
                  including the Primitive Methodist Church, the Wesleyan Reform Church, the Wesleyan
                  Reform Union, and the modern unified Methodist Church. </p>
               <p>The class papers and books are the records kept by class leaders, who recorded not
                  only attendance but also commented upon the spiritual status and progress of
                  individual members. Also contained in this series are various articles and notes
                  by Baker and other scholars on the class meetings and tickets; this secondary
                  material explains not only the history of such materials but also their possible
                  uses for historical research, including local history, genealogy, administration
                  of the growing church was administrated at the local level. Finally, although by
                  the 19th century the tickets had become entirely textual items, many of the
                  earliest tickets were visually elaborate and contain hundreds of examples of 18th
                  century engraving technique.</p>

                  subject, the main difference being that the Committee of Privileges materials were
                  received as a discrete gift from FB, whereas the Broadsides and Circular Letters
                  were gathered from numerous accessions of his papers. The Committee of Privileges
                  material focuses mainly on the controversies in the decade after John Wesley's
                  death in 1791. In addition to church conferences and controversies, another
                  recurrent topic in these printed materials is the formation of a Missionary
                  Society in the 1810s, which in turn opens up the topics of slavery, especially in
                  the West Indies, and Methodist support of the abolitionist movement. Includes many
                  single and fragmentary pieces of various printed materials, found at the end of
                  the series.</p>

                     historical significance of each item. That text is too extensive to be included
                     here in full, but is only quoted at times to clarify the identification or
                     attribution of certain items; however, a full copy of FB's description and
                     commentary is in the information folder at the beginning of the subseries.

                     <p>Correspondence and other documents on the early history of the Wesleyan
                        Methodist missions in Sierra Leone. In an affidavit of 1812 Jan. 28, a
                        citizen of Freetown swears that "George Warren, Preacher in the Connexion of
                        the late Rev. John Wesley," did not pray, preach, or read in the Connexion's
                        meeting house on a Sunday morning earlier that month. An 1848 letter from
                        Francis Collier to Rev. S.R. Hall recalls events of some forty years
                        earlier, regarding Thomas Coke's appointment of Warren to establish a
                        mission in Sierra Leone. And a petition to the Wesleyan Missions in London,
                        also from 1848 and signed by some seventy preachers and class leaders in
                        Sierra Leone, requests that Thomas Dove be re-appointed as General
                        Superintendent of the Sierra Leone missions.</p>

                     <p>Five letters from three physicians and a minister to Dr. John Lettsom
                        (1744-1815), physician, philanthropist, and one of the founders of Medical
                        Society of London. Two letters from Jonathan Stokes, 1792 and 1812, discuss
                        new medical literature, including the Botanical Arrangement and new papers
                        by a Dr. Pearce of Philadelphia. Dr. Vaughn of Leicester (1793), writes to
                        Lettsom about a new disease which, in his experience, kills within 86 hours,
                        and one of the symptoms of which are spasms of the diaphragm unlike any that
                        occur with other known diseases; he posits that this is a disorder of the
                        nervous system as opposed to one resulting from the circulatory fluids, and
                        discusses some experimental treatments. Rev. John Rudd, Preston, writes to
                        Dr. Lettsom in 1811, claiming that an instrument exists, housed in some of
                        the country's palaces, which can revive persons apparently dead; he also
                        mentions the Royal Humane Society, an organization formed in 1774 aimed at
                        reanimating the dead, esp. those who died by drowning; he also refers Dr.
                        Lettsom to others who know more about it and might be able to help
                        further.</p>

                  <p>Letter from Joah Mallinson, 1827 Dec. 25, regarding his unjust trial and
                     expulsion from Wesleyan Methodism; accompanied by the Letter "To the Editors of
                     the Leeds Mercury" from Mallinson and James Sigston (1827 Dec. 13), in which
                     they defend themselves against Wesleyan Methodism. The controversy to which
                     this refers is over placing an organ in Brunswick Chapel, Leeds -- those
                     opposed were expelled from the connexion and started the Protestant Methodist

               <p>Contains engraved portraits, maps, landscapes, architectural renderings, and other
                  subjects that portray many of the important people and places of 18th and 19th
                  century England as the Wesleys and their contemporaries might have known them.
                  Formats include engravings, wood-block prints, photographs, and plates removed
                  from 20th century books and calendars. The <emph render="bold">People
                     Subseries</emph> is devoted almost entirely to Wesley family portraits, the
                  bulk of it to John Wesley, who was one of the most frequent subjects of portraits
                  in 18th century England. The <emph render="bold">Places Subseries</emph> houses
                  some 300 engravings of landscapes and architectural sites. Scenes depicted include
                  many well-known historical sites--Edinburgh Castle, King's College Chapel,
                  Stonehenge--as well as others less familiar to a modern eye, such as Bath or
                  Tintern Abbey as they might have appeared to the young Jane Austen or William
                  Wordsworth. The <emph render="bold">Magazines Subseries</emph> contains groupings
                  of portrait prints from various Methodist and other denominations' magazines from
                  the late 18th through early 20th centuries. In the <emph render="bold">Maps
                     Subseries</emph> are found approximately 250 maps, predominantly consisting of
                  engraved prints from the 18th century. The <emph render="bold">Subjects
                     Subseries</emph> houses images of literary, Biblical, and mythical scenes;
                  pastoral and animal scenes; and painted and photographic copies and reproductions
                  of well-known 18th and 19th century artists. Finally, a small <emph render="bold"
                     >Photographs Subseries</emph> houses albumen, panoramic, and modern black-and
                  white prints, and glass plate negatives. Images portray individuals, churches, and
                  scenes from Europe and the Americas.</p>
               <p>RELATED MATERIALS: In addition to materials housed in this series, several

                  Portraits Subseries; Volumes Series, Albums and Scrapbooks Subseries; and the

               <p>[Duplicates have not been weeded in most subseries, but it should be noted that
                  for many items published prior to about 1820, apparent duplicates may show the
                  minute variations common to copperplate printing. This is especially true in the

                        change in 1822 roughly coincided with the widespread introduction of
                        steel-plate engraving, most of the prints can be assumed as such. There is
                        much less change to these prints over time, as compared to copper-plate, and
                        thus much less evidence of FB's study of this. However, as with the earlier
                        magazines, duplicates here have not been weeded.</p>
                     <p>RELATED MATERIAL: prints from both magazines appear at many other points in
                        the collection, though especially in the Portraits Subseries, above, and in
                        the Volumes Series, Albums and Scrapbooks Subseries.</p>

                     serials, and other unidentified publications, with one of the most frequent
                     sources being <title type="simple" render="italic">The Modern Universal British
                        Traveller,</title> which appeared in several editions in the late 18th
                     century. Although they vary greatly in type, date, and size, they are
                     predominantly prints from copper-plate engravings from the 1760s-1780s, with
                     the most common size being about 14" x 9". There are also smaller format
                     prints, mainly from steel-plate engravings, that date from as late as the
                     1840s. Arranged in alphabetical order, primarily by English county or city
                     name; there are also places beyond England and topical headings for various
                     types of buildings. Unsorted engravings are filed at the end, followed by
                     folders of images in other formats, such as clippings and photographic plates
                     from later books and serials.</p>

                     photographic copies and reproductions of well-known 18th and 19th century

                        >Credulity, Superstition, and Fanaticism. A Medley,</title> is a famous
                     illustration and critique in the early history of British Methodism. At least
                     one of the Falstaff series by 19th century illustrator George Cruikshank
                     appears to have a signed dedication by the artist. The 1814 Ann Hewson
                     needlepoint/crosstitch sampler, "'Gold' and 'Virtue'," if accurately
                     attributed, would constitute a very early document in the history of Primitive
                     Methodism, generally agreed to have been initiated around 1809 by Hugh Bourne,
                     William Clowes, and others. </p>

                  <p>Correspondence, meeting minutes, printed material, research notes, and original
                     source documents for a proposed multi-volume history of British Methodism. A
                     note added by FB in 1990 explains that he originally gathered many of these
                     materials in the 1950s in preparation for his work on "Documents and
                     Bibliography," to be the fourth volume of what he generally refers to as "the
                     New History" (n.b., many materials here indicate this was projected as volume
                     III, not IV). When he moved to the United States in 1960, his role was taken up
                     by John Vickers. The project was never published under its original name. In
                     its stead there eventually appeared the somewhat differently-conceived <title
                        type="simple" render="italic">A History of the Methodist Church in Great
                        Britain</title>, published in four volumes from 1964 through 1988. For this
                     history FB wrote the section entitled <title type="simple" render="doublequote"
                        >The People called Methodist, Pt. 3 Polity</title> (recorded as no. 158,
                     1965, in the Hart bibliography of FB's works). Finally, in 1991 he wrote an
                     extensive review of Volume 4 of the new work, which was in fact edited by
                     Vickers and focused on historical documents, as first contemplated in the 1950s
                     for the concluding volume of the original project.</p>
                  <p>The documents that FB himself collected, however, remained in his own files and
                     eventually came to the library in various accessions of the <emph render="bold"
                        >Frank Baker Papers</emph>. All this material is here transferred to the
                     Wesleyana collection as being the more appropriate setting for the historical
                     documents, many of which are quite fragile. FB's own correspondence and
                     research notes have been placed here as well, due to their possible relevance
                     to the content and provenance of the source materials. Arranged with the
                     original source documents first, chronologically ordered in numbered folders,
                     followed by the work of FB and his colleagues in the following categories:

                     "Billy" Dawson (17YY-1841). The notes are a partial draft of a biography of a
                     man, identity undetermined, who met JW. Also included is an 1849 letter by
                     another William Dawson, whose relation to the elder Dawson is unclear.</p>

                           identified only as "B.I.," presumably the Bristol Intelligencer. The
                           letters debate the legality and justness of the American Revolution,
                           including much discussion of the Americans' grievance "no taxation
                           without representation" and whether this is a legally justifiable
                           complaint in light of the Magna Carta, the colonies' charters, the policy
                           of England in its other colonies, etc. The first letter in the exchange,
                           a rebuttal of JW's "A Calm Address to the American Colonies," is by a
                           writer very much in favor of the American Revolution and very hostile to
                           Wesley. In the course of the debate Wesley himself writes twice to answer
                           his critics, once on 1775 Nov. 25 and again on 1775 Dec. 2. The debate on
                           America continues in subsequent letters by other writers, though with
                           fewer references to Wesley's positions. 78 pages.</p>

                  letterbooks, diaries and journals, scrapbooks, notebooks, record books, and
                  albums. The contents can include autographs; correspondence; memoirs; essays;
                  photographs; engravings; ephemera such as Christams cards, tickets, and stamps;
                  maps; clippings; notes; sermons; histories; and church records. The latter
                  category includes Methodist church account and roll books, circuit schedules,
                  year-by-year histories and journals of various chapels, meeting minutes, and
                  Sunday School rolls. Subseries are arranged alphabetically. Some items are in
                  short-hand. A sample of Wesley's own short-hand from one of his journal entries
                  (1740) is included in an information folder in box WF1, along with illustrations

                        years, as most entries mention Hull addresses as the location of the writer.
                        Autograph entries in many hands by Wesleyan ministers and, in particular, a
                        high proportion of missionaries. The latter often refer to their postings in
                        some way: Henry Bleby's 1851 entry details the history of Coke Chapel,
                        founded in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1792 ; Benjamin Clough, missionary to
                        Ceylon, records the Lord's Prayer in Singhalese; and other entries include
                        one entitled "Pity Poor Africa!" and a Bible verse written in Chippewha.
                        Entries are inscribed on the pages, but also glued and tipped in; portrait
                        engravings of the writers are laid in. Circa 100 pages; not examined closely
                        due to volume's fragility.</p>

                        mid-19th century copies are the earliest-known sources for many of these
                        letters. Since this has not been verified against more recent scholarship
                        and the album contains some thirty letters of John Wesley, a full index is

                  <p>Roughly divided in two series: autograph books, and albums and scrapbooks. The
                     latter house many hundreds of engravings, photographs, letters, printed
                     materials, and other items. Autograph books generally date from the mid-19th
                     century and chiefly consist of autographs of Wesleyan Methodist ministers and
                     church officials. Some books are more specific in focus, such as collections of
                     autographs of attendees at specific conferences, or others that focus on
                     missionaries. Each album is described in detail below.</p>

                     <p>Manuscript collection of twenty-three poems, attributed as unpublished and
                        written circa 1719, bound by James Everett in 1825. Everett added an
                        introduction explaining the volume's history and an afterword discussing the
                        poems, especially the first, "Lamentation for the Loss of Mrs. John
                        Bentley," which is attributed to Matthew Prior by Everett, James Montgomery
                        (who gave the volume to Everett), and internal references. Authors of other
                        poems are usually mentioned by surname only, including Brownsmith, Drake,
                        Harcourt, Lehunt, Mason, Pegge, Rothery, Rowe, and Taylor. Most names are
                        followed by a note indicating their affiliation with St. John's College
                        (presumably Cambridge, not Oxford). The claim that the poems were
                        unpublished is at least partly inaccurate--several had been published well
                        before Everett's time, though possibly with altered content, titles, and
                        misattribution, which may have prevented their discovery. Four examples

                        Matthew Prior. Poem no. 15, "Occasion'd by the Foregoing," attributed to

                        journey, for which he records position and distance sailed each day, and
                        several letters, including letters of introduction for Robert and several
                        from his brother Walter. The latter contain much advice on many matters: how

                        four hymns are missing, and the texts for the 47th and 48th are set to
                        music, by F. Moore.</p>
                     <p>Other materials: three other manuscript items were found with this volume,
                        although their relation to it is uncertain. All three are written in the
                        same hand, which appears different from Flesher's. Each is the contents page
                        of different volumes of sermons. Two list sermons first delivered between
                        circa 1707-1721; the third lists twenty-eight sermons, their Biblical texts,
                        and their authors.</p>

                     <p>Unpublished essay by theological writer Anthony Fothergill (1685/6-1761),
                        father to the physician of the same name. Essay's main thesis criticizes
                        Methodists for stressing doctrine of original sin in a manner similar to
                        that of the Catholic Church, in particular the Jesuits. Dating on title page

                        describing the content of some specific entries of importance, including:
                        11. Dublin Society Book, March 29, 1771, inserted by desire of Wesley,
                        giving rules and power to Leaders of Society; 13. "Rules made for and

                        <p>Crowther mainly discusses Wesleyan Conferences from 1800-1805, describing
                           where they occurred and topics of discussion. Focuses on the practice of
                           circuits requesting certain preachers, and how he feels that is
                           inappropriate. Interesting anecdotes include the expulsion of a Mr. Cook
                           from the Conference and the subsequent counter-preaching that occurred in
                           Rockdale in 1800; and the suicide of Mr. Bradford in 1808.</p>

                        <p>Biography (author unknown) of Rev. Joseph Entwisle (1767-1841). Entwisle
                           contacted Wesley in 1784 (reproduction of Wesley's letter included) about
                           becoming a Methodist preacher and served for 51 years. The biography
                           details mainly places he was stationed (including Northhampton, Leeds,
                           Hull, Bradford, Birmingham, and Bath) and major events in his life.
                           Following the death of his sons in 1830 and 1831, Entwisle retired, then
                           later suffered a stroke in 1841. The biographer includes excerpts from
                           Entwisle's journal for successive years on his birthday, and concludes
                           with his death in 1841.</p>

                     <p>Sixteen sermons, by either William Dawson (d. 1841) or Anthony Dawson (fl.
                        1870s-1880s). Date of original text is uncertain, but later notes penciled
                        at end of each sermon imply they were delivered repeatedly in various places
                        and at various times from 1828-1858. On interior cover, inscribed by both
                        Anthony and William Dawson. A card tipped in gives the dates of baptism,
                        confirmation, and first communion for Anthony Dawson, 1870-1889. Circa 300

                     <p>Lectures on Methodist history and missions by Benjamin Hellier (circa
                        1825-1888), Governor of Headingley College. Possibly the notebook of W. E.
                        Fletcher, whose name is inscribed on the title page. Seventeen numbered
                        lectures cover JW's life and ancestry in some detail, his years at Oxford
                        and in Georgia, his experience at Aldersgate, his relationship with George
                        Whitefield, and Methodism's relationship to the Church of England. Three
                        unnumbered lectures at end of the volume take up early Methodist missions,
                        including discussions of the Gilbert family in the West Indies and Methodism
                        in America and Canada.</p>

                     <p>Neither item is a holograph manuscript, and neither was originally
                        attributed to Ingham. The "Diary," written almost entirely in shorthand, is
                        a bound microfilm printout of the original, held at the John Rylands
                        University, and entitled as "Diary of James Hervey." It was identified as
                        the diary of Ingham only in the 1960s by Richard P. Heitzenrater, and is the
                        item that helped him begin to decipher the Wesley brothers' shorthand
                        system. The second item, a sermon on Ezekiel 18:21-23, is a printed item
                        that has either been extracted from a larger source or, if whole, has had
                        its cover and all front matter removed. A penciled note on the first page,
                        probably in FB's hand, states "Not Wesley. Ingham [2 or 3 indecipherable
                        words] 1738]." Diary is approximately 200 pages; sermon is 20 pages,
                        concluded by a two-page "Hymn," unattributed.</p>

                           (1756-1791), later Mrs. William Christian. A dressmaker who moved from
                           London to Grantham, Lincolnshire in 1777, Gretton is chiefly known from a
                           series of 10 letters John Wesley wrote to her from 1781-1785. This
                           autobiography mainly covers the years prior to her marriage. Gretton
                           relates some anecdotes from her childhood and adult life, including
                           illnesses, her marriage, and religious life. The autobiography contains
                           some of her correspondence with JW and with her sister.</p>

                           tells in great detail the story of Thomas Chatterton (1752-1770),
                           concluding with a sympathetic account of his death at the age of 17.
                           Stampe particularly focuses on anti-Methodist sentiments in Chatterton's
                           poetry and tries to discern through various writings what his religious
                           views might have been. He uses Chatterton's alleged suicide--still
                           assumed as fact in the 19th century--to teach a lesson about melancholy,
                           despair, and compassion.</p>

                        <p>Items 2 and 3 below (numbered in pencil on title page) were first
                           described as part of the Baker Wesleyana collection in the mid-1980s.
                           Item 1 (unnumbered) was found some 25 years later, in 2010, without
                           provenance, but appears obviously to go with the other two, due to

                           Bucklesham, Rushmore, and Wheatley--at various times in the 1750s-1760s,
                           then again in the early 1800s. Three volumes of 40 pages each.</p>

                           found a quote attributed to Hakluyt (Richard Hakluyt, 1552?-1616), which
                           is part of his rationale for dating the book ca. 1650. Volume opens with
                           an index of Latin nouns, followed by pages listing sayings and epigrams
                           are apparently used. Sources of the quotations are obscured, but many
                           appear attributed to "Hall." Interspersed with these pages are sections

                        <p>Detailed diary kept by an unidentified man who maintained Wesley's book
                           room at Wesley Chapel, Bristol, and also assisted Wesley with correcting
                           proofs for his publications. Diary entries span two years, although the
                           bulk of the entries occur from 1752 Oct.-1753 Oct., after which there are
                           occasional gaps of several months. Entries often detail the writer's
                           daily routine, and include details of his work, social interactions,
                           reading, and thoughts about social and religious issues of the day.
                           Numerous interactions with both John and Charles Wesley are alluded to.
                           He describes his work reading and correcting proofs from JW's publishers,
                           with the printer Felix Farley, Bristol, being most often mentioned. He
                           reports his own attendance at Methodist meetings, although typically
                           gives few details on these. His opinions on contemporaneous writers are
                           recorded, especially with JW's <title type="simple" render="doublequote"
                              >Thoughts on Marriage and a Single Life</title> (1743).</p>
                        <p>RELATED MATERIAL AND CITATION INFORMATION: Patrons are advised that this
                           is the same item that may have been cited in scholarly literature as the
                           "Thomas Butts Diary." In cataloging prior to 2011, this item had long
                           been mis-attributed to Butts, who served as one of Wesley's book stewards
                           in the early 1750s. With new access to FB's notes, it became clear that
                           FB never agreed with this attribution and that there is in fact little
                           scholarly evidence to support it. Although the diary was transcribed in
                           2008 by Thomas Albin, and electronic copies of Albin's transcription are
                           available in the library, this work was undertaken without access to the
                           Frank Baker Papers. A more recent revision of the Albin transcription has
                           been made by Randy Maddox, Duke Divinity School, and is now available on
                           the Web site of the Wesley Studies Center, Duke University Divinity
                           School, where it is cited as "Bristol Steward's Diary, 1752-1754." In
                           addition, FB's notes on the diary are available in Frank Baker Papers,

               <p>Correspondence, research notes, albums, clippings, and a variety of other
                  materials created and collected by F. F. Bretherton (1868-1956), a Wesleyan
                  Methodist minister and historian with a lifelong interest in many of the same
                  topics in church history as Frank Baker. A generation older than FB, Bretherton
                  became one of the founding members of the Wesley Historical Society in the late
                  19th century, later serving as its Secretary from 1919, and as President from
                  1941.</p>
               <p>PROVENANCE AND RELATED MATERIAL: The approximately 1500 items gathered in this
                  series comprise only a small portion of the materials Bretherton gave to FB in the
                  1940s and 1950; the bulk of his materials were filed by FB with his own and appear
                  in many places in the Baker collections. These manuscripts can sometimes be
                  recognized by the initials "FFB" penciled on items, but more often are
                  recognizable only through familiarity with Bretherton's handwriting. Some eighty
                  monographs from Bretherton, dating to 1785, can be found in the Duke Library's
                  online catalog using the keyword <emph render="bold">provenance
                  bretherton</emph>.</p>

                  <p>Writings and sermons of Thomas Burton (1662-1731), Vicar of Halifax, England,
                     from 1712 until his death in 1731. Seven volumes containing approximately
                     ninety sermons preached from 1707-1731; and two volumes entitled <title
                        type="simple" render="doublequote">An Exposition of the Church Catechism,
                        for the Instruction of the Youth of Halifax Parish in the Diocese of
                        York.</title> Sermons were given on national occasions, such as the 1713
                     thanksgiving for peace sermon, the 1714 martyrdom of King Charles I, one on the
                     thanksgiving for deliverance from Gunpowder Treason, the 1714 King's Accession,
                     and various Saint's Days.</p>
                  <p>Several volumes were extensively prepared for publication, complete with
                     footnotes; some accompanied by contents pages and further notes indicating when
                     and where the sermons were preached (most often in Halifax). FB's notes on the
                     gift record comment that these unpublished sermons illustrate "the spiritual
                     tone of the Church of England immediately before the Methodist revival."</p>

                        undetermined, although hand-written corrections may be in FB's hand; date of
                        typescript is also uncertain, but attached correspondence indicates FB made
                        this copy in 1971.</p>

                  <p>Collection comprises a scrapbook containing correspondence, reproductions of
                     engravings, poetry, autographs, a pencil drawing, and an account of
                     astrological incidents; there is also a small group of loose items. The
                     correspondence is related to the Perronet family and other early leaders of the
                     Wesleyan movement in England, and includes letters from Vincent Perronet
                     stating his religious beliefs and moral principles, and letters from Charles
                     Wesley to Peard Dickinson, Vincent's grandson-in-law, concerning doctrinal
                     matters and family and personal subjects. Other correspondents include Sarah
                     Wesley, Joseph Benson, Adam Clarke, James Dixon, Joseph Entwisle, John William
                     Fletcher, Mary (Bosanquet) Fletcher, Thomas Jackson, Henry Moore, and Richard
                     Watson. Loose items include a discourse by Charles Perronet on man's need for
                     religion; diaries of an unidentified young woman commenting on sermons and
                     spiritual life; and miscellaneous letters and autographs.</p>

                  <p>Methodist clergyman and Evangelist from England who traveled to the U.S. and
                     was a major influence in the "Great Awakening" religious revival in the U.S.
                     Papers comprise a letter, 1750, discussing religious affairs in Georgia and
                     South Carolina, the activities of James Habersham, and preaching missions to
                     African Americans; a letter, 1759, to John Ryland, praising a young man for his
                     Christian dedication; two letters, 1767 and 1768, to "My Dear M. Winter" in
                     Bristol, and a short commentary on an unidentified passage from the Bible.</p>
