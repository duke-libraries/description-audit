            Louise Shields, and members of their family were Methodist missionaries in Angola
            between the 1890s and the 1960s. The Shields Family Papers consist of correspondence,
            legal papers, and photographs created by three generations of a missionary family. The
            correspondence documents the experiences of a missionary family in Angola (Luanda and
            Malange) and Zimbabwe (including the Umtali region) in the early twentieth century, and
            includes letters written from family members in England, among them letters written from
            Greta Gazeley to her mother, Wilhelmina Shields Gazeley, in the 1950s. The photographs,
            dating from the early 1900s to the 1960s, portray the lives of missionaries in Africa
            through portraits and snapshots of the Shields family and other groups both European,
            American and African, as well as photographs of groups of schoolchildren, mission
            buildings, and various scenes of African life and landscapes. The collection includes a
            handwritten memoir by Robert Shields, a biographical account of Louise Raven Shield's
            life compiled by her daughter, Irene Withey Shields, and various writings by Irene
            Withey Shields and Wilhelmina Taylor Shields on their experiences in Africa. Acquired as
            part of the John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and African American History
            and Culture at Duke University.</abstract>

         <p>Reverend Robert Shields, his wife Louise Shields, and members of their family were
            Methodist missionaries in Angola between the 1890s and the 1960s. Members of the
            Methodist Episcopal Church, Robert and Louise Shields went to Africa from Ireland and
            the United States, respectively, in the 1880s and 1890s as part of Bishop William
            Taylor's self-supporting missions. They worked as missionaries in Angola until 1936, and
            their children and grandchildren remained in Angola and Zimbabwe. Robert Shields, born
            in Ireland in 1866, moved to Angola as a missionary in 1887. There he married Lizzie
            Whiteside of Newry, Ireland in 1891. Lizzie died in 1895, and their son Wesley died at a
            young age. Shields remarried in 1895, to Louise Raven, who had moved from Chicago to
            join the mission in Angola. They worked in Quessua, Angola until 1902, when they moved
            to Luanda, Angola. Robert and Louise had five living children: Robert Dodson (born
            1896), Irene Withey (born 1899), Margaret Louise (born 1902), Helen Augusta (born 1903),
            and Wilhelmina Taylor (born 1905). They also had a daughter, Suzanna, who died at three
            months from malaria.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Shields Family Papers consist of correspondence, legal papers, and photographs
            created by three generations of a missionary family. The correspondence documents the
            experiences of a missionary family in Angola (Luanda and Malange) and Zimbabwe
            (including the Umtali region) in the early twentieth century. In 1903, Louise Shields
            brought her children to live in London and gave birth to Helen there; much of the
            correspondence is between Louise and Robert during this period of separation. Leaving
            her children in England to return to Angola, Louise received additional correspondence
            from the woman who took care of the children in her absence. Also included in the
            correspondence is a series of letters written by Greta Gazeley to her mother Wilhelmina
            Taylor Shields Gazeley in the 1950s. The legal papers in the collection consist of
            marriage certificates, copies of birth certificates, an immigration visa for Robert
            Shields, and US Army discharge papers for Robert Dodson Shields. In addition, the
            collection includes a handwritten memoir by Robert Shields, a biographical account of
            Louise Raven Shield's life compiled by her daughter, Irene Withey Shields, and various
            writings by Irene Withey Shields and Wilhelmina Taylor Shields on their experiences in
            Africa. Also included are Irene's and Wilhelmina's diplomas from the University of Cape
            Town.</p>
         <p>The extensive collection of photographs, dating from the early 1900s to the 1960s,
            provide a portrait of the lives of missionaries in Africa. The majority are portraits
            and snapshots of the Shields family and other groups both European, American, and
            African, as well as photographs of groups of schoolchildren, mission buildings, and
            various scenes of African life and landscapes. Several of the family portraits were
            taken during the family's time in England. The collection contains one photograph of
            Bishop William Taylor and a young African boy. Also included are a number of picture
            postcards. With the exception of three photograph albums, the photographs are unsorted
            and the majority are undated.</p>
