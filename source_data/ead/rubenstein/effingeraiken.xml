         <abstract id="aspace_cc6736a5a3377708032e17a9644d5012">The wholesale firm of Effinger &amp;
            Aiken, located in Baltimore, Maryland, supplied consumer goods to stores in cities and
            rural towns from Maryland to Florida during the early 1900s. The collection includes
            eight business account books of Effinger &amp; Aiken together with roughly 350 related
            business correspondence and papers. The account books document the firm's sale and
            shipping of goods such as crockery, glassware, wooden items, hardware, tools, and
            building materials throughout the southern Atlantic states. Each of two leather-bound
            ledgers begins with an alphabetical index listing the customer and internal accounts
            recorded within the ledger and their corresponding page numbers. The related business
            correspondence and papers, which chiefly document the firm's difficulties with debt
            collection, are loosely inserted in these ledgers near the associated customer accounts.
            Four cloth-bound daybooks record customer names with itemized purchase and/or payment
            transactions each day. The daybook with entries from 1895 to 1896 most likely does not
            pertain to the transactions of Effinger &amp; Aiken. One small, cloth-bound account book
            records, in tabular form, amounts "Collect," "Cash," "Credit," and "Wholesale" for each
            day of the month from June 1905 to July 1920; and another small, cloth-bound account
            book records daily collections from 1906 to 1907.</abstract>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The wholesale firm of Effinger &amp; Aiken (partners Charles H. Effinger and George B.
            Aiken), located in Baltimore, Maryland, supplied consumer goods to hundreds of hardware,
            grocery, drug, and general goods stores in cities and rural towns in Maryland, Virginia,
            West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida during the early
            1900s. Several traveling salesmen represented the firm; and goods such as cutlery,
            crockery, glassware, wooden items, hardware, tools, rope, saddles, guns and ammunition,
            fishing and hunting equipment, wagon wheels and axels, farm equipment, and building
            materials generally were shipped by railroad freight.</p>
         <p>The firm's beginning and ending dates of operation are unclear. However, the <title
               type="simple" render="italic">R.L. Polk &amp; Co's Baltimore City Directory for
               1899</title> lists Effinger as a partner in Ramsey &amp; Effinger, a firm
            specializing in china, glassware, and house furnishing goods; and the <title
               type="simple" render="italic">Federal Reporter, Volume 184</title> indicates that on
            February 9, 1909, the partnership of Effinger &amp; Aiken and each partner individually
            were adjudicated bankrupts.</p>
