            pharmacologist and scientist on the faculty of the University of Vienna in the early
            20th century. The papers are mostly in German, and consist of Meyer's professional
            correspondence; diplomas and awards; a few professional writings; an autograph book with
            signatures and correspondence of notable scientists and others; genealogical papers
            relating to his attempts in the late 1930s to document his family's ancestry; several
            volumes, including a family Bible and a diary of his son Arthur's first six years of
            life; and professional and personal photographs. There are two photographs of
            neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing (Boston), inscribed to Meyer (1914 and 1929), and a sketch
            by Cushing. There are a few letters from family members, one of which describes in
            detail the correspondent's experience in Poland during the invasion of that country by
            the Germans, and his or her return to Germany. An addition to the collection consists of
            a few letters, photographs, negatives, and other memorabilia relating to Meyer's son,
            Arthur W. Meyer, personal physician to Boris III, King of Bulgaria, and Arthur's son
            Horst, who became a physicist at Duke University. The Hans Horst Meyer papers form part
            of the History of Medicine Collections at Duke University.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Hans Horst Meyer holds a prominent place at the historical intersection of pharmacology
            and anesthesia. His greatest achievement was in the formulation of the lipoid theory of
            narcosis which still stands today largely unchallenged. Published in 1899, Meyer's
            classic paper proposed that the ability of a substance to produce narcosis or anesthesia
            is governed by its partition coefficient. He shares the honor as the cofounder of this
            theory with Charles Overton who independently arrived at the same conclusion at the same
            time although indirectly through a study of permeability of plant and animal cells to
            various substances. The Meyer-Overton theory stimulated decades of research to answer
            important questions of exactly how certain drugs can act to produce a state of
            anesthesia. [Taken from <title type="simple" render="italic">Trent Associates
               Report</title> 12, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2004): 1-2]</p>
         <p>Meyer was born in Insterburg, East Prussia (now part of Russia), and studied medicine in
            Königsberg, Leipzig, and Berlin. He held the chair of pharmacology at the University of
            Marburg from 1884 to 1904, and was then professor at the Vienna Medical School from 1904
            to 1924, when he retired. Meyer died in Vienna in October, 1939.</p>
         <p>Meyer had three sons, Kurt Heinrich, Arthur Woldemar, and Friedrich Horst, who died as a
            child. In 1933, Arthur Meyer shot his wife, then committed suicide, following the
            family's persecution following accusations of Jewish ancestry. Arthur Meyer's son, Horst
            Meyer, was adopted by his uncle Kurt, and was a professor of physics at Duke University
            from 1959 to 2004. [Source: Wikipedia, June 2014.] </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The papers, mostly in German, document pharmacologist and scientist Hans Horst Meyer's
            career and personal life, and consist of personal and professional correspondence;
            written pieces; genealogical documents; diplomas, medals, and awards; a Bible and other
            assorted volumes; professional and personal photographs; and an autograph album.</p>
         <p>The certificates and medals were received by Meyer between 1901 and 1937, and come from
            a variety of international scientific organizations, such as the New York Academy of
            Medicine, the Royal Society of Physicians in Budapest, and the Swedish Royal Academy of
            Sciences. Meyer also received the German Order of the Red Eagle and honorary citizenship
            of the city of Vienna. Also included is a small group of letters and printed materials
            relating to honors received by Meyer, as well as a reprint of Meyer's chapter in the
               <title render="italic">Handbuch der experimentellen Pharmakologie</title>.</p>
         <p>Of note are two portrait photographs of pioneer neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing (1914 and
            1929), both inscribed to Hans Horst Meyer, and a warm letter from Cushing to Meyer's son
            Arthur, a physician. A sketch of a spongioblast, attributed to Cushing, rounds out this
            group.</p>
         <p>The personal papers include a group of official documents, identity and voting cards,
            and correspondence with parishes and German officials, attesting to Meyer's efforts from
            about 1938 to 1939 to document his family's religious heritage and obtain a new German
            identity card, possibly in order to leave the country. Meyer died in Vienna in 1939
            while his application was still under review. Also among the personal papers are a few
            letters from family members, one of which, dated October 6, 1939, describes in detail
            the correspondent's experience in Poland during the invasion of that country by the
            Germans, and his or her return to Germany. </p>
         <p>Meyer's personal papers are accompanied by a German bible, a volume of poetry and
            quotations, and a journal in which Meyer recorded his son Arthur's first six years of
            life. There are also photographs of Hans Horst Meyer with various family members: his
            wife Doris, shortly after marriage, his sons Arthur and Kurt, his daughter-in-law Lotte,
            and grandchildren.</p>
         <p>The autograph album contains 147 autographs and letters of well-known and lesser-known
            Germans, most of whom lived in the 19th century. Included are a letter each from Johann
            Wolfgang von Goethe, Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller, and Clara Schumann, a
            postcard from Johannes Brahms, and the autographs of many individuals, including Henrik
            Ibsen and Charles Dickens.</p>
         <p>An addition to the collection consists of personal memorabilia, including photographs,
            glass slides, and a few letters, relating to Hans Horst Meyer's son Arthur, and his
            close relationship as personal physician to Boris III, King of Bulgaria, until Arthur's
            suicide in 1933. The letters are addressed to (Johannes) Horst Meyer, Arthur's small
            son, who eventually became a physicist, emigrated to the U.S., and joined the faculty of
            Duke University.</p>
         <p>With the exception of the autograph album, originally in the holdings of the Rubenstein
            Library general collections, the Meyer papers were acquired as part of the History of
            Medicine Collections at Duke University.</p>

               <p>Correspondence and printed material relating to the honors received by Meyer, as
                  well as a reprint of Meyer's chapter in the <title type="simple" render="italic"
                     >Handbuch der experimentellen Pharmakologie</title>. Also includes 49
                  manuscript and printed items related to Hans Horst Meyer's professional career,
                  and his search for his family's religious origins in light of events unfolding in
                  Nazi Germany. The latter group consists of: letters of inquiry, responses from
                  offices, and genealogical documents listing his parents and grandparents and their
                  religious status as Lutherans; a few pieces of personal and professional
                  correspondence from the 1930s; and official documents pertaining to Meyer's own
                  status and applications for an identity card. This group also includes a series of
                  small photographs - head shots of Meyer taken for travel documents - and an
                  undated carte-de-visite of Meyer and probably his wife, Doris, probably from the
                  1890s. The professional correspondence chiefly relates to congratulations or
                  announcements of awards and honorary degrees. Almost all the documents are in
                  German. The papers are arranged in chronological order.</p>

               <p>This collection of letters, memorabilia, and ephemera tell of the close
                  relationship between Arthur Woldemar Meyer, Hans Horst Meyer's son, and Boris III,
                  Czar of Bulgaria. Arthur Meyer was the royal family's personal physician. Meyer
                  committed double suicide with his wife in 1933 after he and his family were
                  accused of Jewish ancestry. Boris III died suddenly in 1943.</p>
               <p>The items in the collection include two affectionate letters written by Boris III
                  to Horst Meyer, Arthur Meyer's young son; photographs of Boris III and his family
                  and household, including Arthur Meyer, and government officials; paper ephemera,
                  chiefly state dinner seating lists with Arthur's name included; pieces of jewelry
                  with royal monograms and related symbols, and a pocket watch; and a set of
                  positive black-and-white stereoscopic slides (45x107 mm) with their original
                  viewer and copy negatives. The images are chiefly of Boris and his household; a
                  few are of Hans Horst Meyer with a child, probably his grandson Horst Meyer.</p>
