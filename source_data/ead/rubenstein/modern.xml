         <p>The American Literature Section Papers (1922-1994) were transferred from the University
            of Wisconsin, Madison (1985) and donated by Section members (1983-1995).</p>
         <p>No systematic preservation of records has ever been supervised by the American
            Literature Section itself. Henry Pochmann, English professor at the University of
            Wisconsin, realized in the late 1960s that the opportunity to assemble an archive
            reaching back to the Section's early days was rapidly disappearing. He solicited
            material from all those past officers of the ALS he was able to contact, thereby forming
            the basis of the collection. Beginning with 1928, the collection of annual reports,
            committee work, and correspondence is extremely thorough. Some periods are documented by
            the files of several members, some by only one, but little of the Section's history
            seems to have been lost.</p>
         <p>Pochmann's original collection was housed at the University of Wisconsin until 1985,
            when it was transferred to the Hubbell Center. By that time, newly-generated files had
            been coming directly to the Hubbell Center for two years. Material was not deposited
            regularly over the following decade, but retrospective collecting was done at the time
            the collection was organized into its present form.</p>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The American Literature Group was formed in 1921, after the Modern Language Association
               <abbr>(MLA) </abbr>reluctantly acknowledged a growing scholarly interest in the
            writing of the United States. At the time such literature was studied primarily in
            secondary schools, and most colleges and universities had no courses on the topic. Those
            that did, usually offered only a single survey course. The idea that American literature
            could stand on its own as a discipline was viewed with skepticism, it being understood
            at the time as a branch of the literature of England - a branch almost wholly lacking
            the greatness of its parent.</p>
         <p>The members of the new group felt that in order to prove their subject reputable, they
            must bring it into line with the model of disciplines that had come into being in the
            late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. This model was based on the empiricism of
            the sciences, which had been modified in English as philology, author biography, textual
            history, and in its furthest speculative reach, influence study. Interpretive criticism
            was viewed as insufficiently scholarly, the domain of the "amateurs" who had dominated
            writing about American literature up to this point. Similarly, some in the Group thought
            that it should organize a way to better train secondary school teachers in the area, but
            this was rejected as insufficiently academic.</p>
         <p>The Group met each December at the annual meeting of the Modern Language Association.
            Many of the early papers presented under the auspices of the Group dealt with the
            problem of how to build a proper discipline. Work was immediately begun on
            bibliographies and on lists of manuscript resources and dissertations written (or
            needed). In 1926, as an aid to research, the field was divided into three areas: the
            Puritan tradition, Romanticism in American literature, and the frontier spirit. In 1928,
            the Group's approach was documented by the essays in <title type="simple"
               render="italic">The Reinterpretation of American Literature</title> (edited by Norman
            Forester), which added a fourth area, realism. Efforts to establish a quarterly journal
            that dealt exclusively with American literature began in 1924. Duke University
            eventually won a small bidding war for it, and the first issue of <title type="simple"
               render="italic">American Literature</title> was dated March, 1929. In 1928 a full
            scheme of officers and procedures was put into place with the first version of the
            articles of organization. This document would be periodically revised over the following
            decades. One project that never got off the ground was a history of American literature.
            Almost from its inception, the Group was dissatisfied with the existing one - <title
               type="simple" render="italic">The Cambridge History of American Literature</title>
            (1918) - because it was written prior to the discovery of much information, gave no
            relative weight to different figures and genres, and had no overarching vision of the
            area. A committee headed by Robert Speller worked toward a plan for a new history during
            the thirties, but conflicting positions concerning readiness and approach caused the
            plan to be abandoned by 1941. (Speller proceeded with the project outside of the Group,
            his work resulting in <title type="simple" render="italic">The Literary History of the
               United States</title> (1948).)</p>
         <p>After World War II, with American literature firmly in place as an academic area, the
            Group became less central to the discipline's development. The rise of American studies
            in the early 1950s prompted discussion and dispute concerning the difference between
            cultural-historical work, and more traditional emphases on literary excellence and the
            humanistic approach to literature (particularly in the classroom). Insurgent movements
            occasionally have arisen as the Group was felt to be behind the critical times. In 1968
            younger members staged a protest at the annual meeting, agitating for a direct
            denouncement of the Vietnam War and more explicit politics in general (particularly
            regarding the college students whom the professors were serving). Meanwhile the Group
            (which became a full-fledged MLA Section in 1966) has periodically had to fight for
            particular kinds of recognition and privilege within its parent organization.</p>
         <p>A full list of the Group's/Section's Chairs and Secretaries (later Executive
            Coordinators) is appended to this inventory and may be used as a cross-reference with
            the container lists to interpret the collection's coverage of various periods and
            figures. A fuller listing of officers from 1921-1948 is provided in Kermit Vanderbilt's
            book (cited below) on pages 545-548.</p>

            by Secretaries or Chairs and mechanically-reproduced reports, minutes, and ballots.
            These last materials are contained in folders designated "Reports" and dated by year.
            Additionally, there are folders of material used to compile reports (such as
            institutional polls and other "raw" information) generated by committees, concerning the
               <title type="simple" render="italic">American Literature</title> journal and Section
            organization, and copies of papers to be delivered at Section meetings. Correspondents
            include Joseph Blotner, Edward Bradley, Edwin Cady, Paul Carter, Alexander Cowie,
            Richard Beale Davis, Robert Falk, Benjamin Franklin Fisher, William M. Gibson, Allan
            Halline, Harrison Hayford, Elaine Hedges, J. Herber, High Holman, Jay B. Hubbell,
            Alexander Kern, Robert Edson Lee, J.A. Leo Lemay, Michael Millgate, William Mulder,
            Russel B. Nye, R.H. Pearce, Henry Pochmann, Walter B. Rideout, Louis D. Rubin, Robert
            Spiller, Willard Thorp, Arlin Turner, and James Woodress. Papers of the following
            individuals (past officers of the ALS), which pertain to the American Literature Group,
            are included in this collection: Joseph Blotner, John Gerber, Robert Edson Lee, Ernest
            Marchand, William Mulder, Charles Nilon, Henry Pochmann, Lewis P. Simpson, Robert
            Spiller, Willard Thorp, Arlin Turner, and Donald Yannella. Also, there are folders
            pertaining to these publications: <title type="simple" render="italic">Reinterpretation
               of American Literature,</title>
            <title type="simple" render="italic">Eight American Authors,</title> and <title
               type="simple" render="italic">American Literary Scholarship.</title>
         </p>
         <p>The folders are arranged chronologically based on the date of the earliest material
            contained in them. A few exceptions have been made for folders where the material is
            very unrepresentative of the whole. These folders are nonetheless dated by their entire
            span. Researchers are advised to begin with the "Reports" folders within the period that
            interests them, for they provide an overview of the year useful for making sense of
            contemporary folders of manuscript material, and in some cases indicate activities that
            have no documentation outside of these reports. Minutes from the December meetings
            sometimes occur as a discrete document and sometimes as part of a report mailed to
            Section members early in the following year. Since even these reports rarely contain
            much information that dates from later than the meeting, they have been placed in the
            "Reports" folders of the year of the meeting documented (i.e. reports dated early in one
            year appear in the folder for the previous year).</p>
         <p>The records of the Section are augmented by the individual papers of a number of Section
            Chairs and Secretaries, also housed in the Hubbell Center.</p>
         <p>Addition (00-041) (6 items, .1 lin. ft.; dated 1994-1999) includes annual reports for
            the ALS, 1994-1998, and a mold used to cast the Jay B. Hubbell medals.</p>
         <p>Addition (08-267) (300 items, .3 lin. ft.; dated 1974-1987) includes records for the
            section’s Advisory Council over the period, as well as for the awarding of the 1986
            Hubbell Medal.</p>

         <head>Processing Note</head>
         <p>Because the American Literature archive was created retrospectively out of a large
            number of separate contributions, some of which overlapped with others and some of which
            consisted of material separated by years or decades, it was decided that chronological
            interfiling made the most sense. Files generated by a single person over a discrete
            period were left intact and organized internally by date. If such files were donated
            with pre-existing separations (material relating to a particular committee, for
            example), those divisions were retained. To the extent that it was possible, each
            discrete project, committee, or body of material relating to a particular event was
            given its own folder, and thus title, to aid finding. If the producer of a portion of
            material was named or deducible, that name appears as part of the folder title. A
            significant part of the total material of the archive consisted of duplicate mailings,
            minutes, and reports. All such material was extracted, and the best copy of each was
            placed in that year's "Reports" folder.</p>
