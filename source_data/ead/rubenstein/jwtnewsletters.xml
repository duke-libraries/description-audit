      <abstract id="aspace_d0ba71b7bb24805f391bdd779dbc44bd">The J. Walter Thompson Company (JWT),
        founded in 1864, is one of the largest enduring advertising agencies in the U.S. The
        Newsletter Collection comprises the agency's internally produced newsletters, which date
        from 1916 through 2005. Newsletters survive from the main office, certain domestic and
        international offices (particularly from Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, London, Los Angeles, New
        York and San Francisco), and divisions and affiliates (especially Brouillard Communications;
        Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein; Dialog; and Thompson Recruitment Advertising) of JWT.
        Topics contained in the newsletters include staff biographical information; office events;
        account and client news; featured campaigns; marketing; merchandising; consumer behavior;
        research and planning; developments and issues in television, radio, and print media; and
        personal activities of the staff. Most of the newsletters are in English, but German,
        Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese language publications are also present. As the
        Company continues to publish house organs, the collection will continue to grow.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">J. Walter Thompson Company (JWT) Newsletter Collection</emph>
        comprises the advertising agency's internally produced newsletters, which date from 1916
        through 2005. Included are newsletters from the main office, certain domestic and
        international offices (particularly from Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, London, Los Angeles, New
        York and San Francisco), and divisions and affiliates of JWT (especially Brouillard
        Communications; Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein; and Thompson Recruitment Advertising). The
        newsletters document JWT's business over the years by providing a forum for JWT staff
        worldwide to report on their activities and on developments in the advertising industry.
        Topics include staff biographical information; office events; account and client news;
        featured campaigns; marketing; merchandising; consumer behavior; research and planning;
        developments and issues in television, radio, and print media; and personal activities of
        the staff. In addition, the newsletters reflect many aspects of the corporate culture that
        set the tone of life in JWT offices. They report events such as blood drives, baseball
        games, office parties, staff retreats, and more. The sense of civic duty that JWT tried to
        instill in its personnel by encouraging its staff members to volunteer in their communities
        runs through many of the newsletters, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, often concurrent
        with the agency's Ad Council and public service work.</p>
      <p>The physical form of the newsletters evolved from several stapled, typewritten pages in the
        1910s and early 1920s, to a (usually) four-page typeset newsletter in the 1950s, to a short
        newsprint magazine in the 1970s, to a longer glossy magazine in the 1980s. In the 1990s,
        some newsletters switched to a fully electronic format. The entries for each newsletter in
        this inventory detail the frequency of publication of the newsletters, the availability of
        indexes, irregularities in volume numbering and dating, and other pertinent information.
        Most of the newsletters are in English, but German, Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese
        language publications are also present. Publications will be added to the collection as the
        archives receives and processes newsletter additions.</p>
      <p>The collection is arranged into three series and four indexes: <emph render="bold">Main
          Newsletters</emph>, <emph render="bold">Domestic Newsletters</emph>, and <emph
          render="bold">International Newsletters</emph>; and an <emph render="bold">Alphabetical
          List of Newsletter Titles</emph>, an <emph render="bold">Alphabetical List By Client of
            <emph render="doublequote">Campaign of the Week</emph> Articles</emph>, <emph
          render="bold"><title type="simple" render="italic">News Bulletin</title> Contents by
          Author</emph>, and <emph render="bold"><title type="simple" render="italic">News
            Bulletin</title> Contents by Title.</emph>
      </p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Main Newsletters Series</emph> holds the primary house organ for
        the company and includes some market research results as well as the opening of many
        international offices in 1929 and 1930. Newsletter articles includes account news, client
        lists--or account gains and losses--and biographies and short notes on JWT staff, including
        professional accomplishments, promotions and transfers, visits to other JWT offices, and
        personal events (i.e. marriages, births, and deaths). </p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Domestic Newsletters Series</emph> is divided into three
          subseries--<emph render="bold">Offices</emph>, <emph render="bold">Divisions</emph>, and
          <emph render="bold">Other Newsletters</emph>. The <emph render="bold">Offices
          Subseries</emph> documents activities in the major JWT offices in the U.S.--Atlanta,
        Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. The office newsletters reported
        account gains and losses, campaign updates, and other business news, with substantial
        coverage of local events such as staff promotions and transfers, wedding and birth
        announcements, office parties, anniversaries, company-related sports events, personal and
        social news. They also updated local staff on news from elsewhere in the agency. Many of
        these publications were issued regularly as supplements to the main company newsletter
        published in New York; for instance, the <title type="simple" render="doublequote">New York
          News,</title> at some points during the 1960s, was printed on the back page of the <title
          type="simple" render="italic">J. Walter Thompson Company News.</title> The <emph
          render="bold">Divisions Subseries</emph> includes newsletters from subsidiaries and
        corporate divisions such as Brouillard Communications (JWT division for corporate
        advertising and public relations), Dialog (JWT division for public relations), Lord, Geller,
        Federico, Einstein (JWT affiliate for premium advertising), and Thompson Recruitment
        Advertising (previously named World Wide Agency, the JWT division for employee recruitment
        advertising). The newsletters report client gains and losses of the division and its
        individual offices, staff transfers and promotions, marriage and birth announcements, and
        other personal and social news. Some newsletters primarily address issues and developments
        pertaining to the specific aspect of advertising with which the division/affiliate concerns
        itself. The <emph render="bold">Other Newsletters Subseries</emph> includes publications
        that deal with advertising issues beyond a specific office's activities, along with
        newsletters issued by the Information Centers of the New York and Chicago offices that
        described their holdings or abstracted articles from newspapers and magazines relating to
        advertising. The newsletters address a broad range of issues relating to the advertising
        industry--marketing; merchandising; research; planning; consumer behavior; client news;
        major staff changes for agency executives from JWT offices worldwide; reports on single
        accounts or industries; and reports from the television, radio, print, and other media.</p>
      <p>Newsletters from JWT offices in Canada, Latin America, Europe, Asia/Pacific, and Africa are
        found in the <emph render="bold">International Series</emph>. Most of these newsletters
        report the business of the offices and of the agency as a whole, noting account gains and
        losses, campaign results, market surveys, and other developments. News of office parties and
        anniversaries, employee transfers and promotions, staff birthdays and marriages, visits from
        JWT executives from other offices, and other social and cultural news are often included in
        the newsletters; for some newsletters, such lighter news comprises the bulk of the
        information published. A few newsletters cover much more specific marketing topics, such as
          <title type="simple" render="italic">Food and Drink News</title> from London and <title
          type="simple" render="italic">JWT Media Information</title> from Australia.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>The <emph render="bold">Main Newsletters Series</emph> comprises the primary house
            organ for the company, in all versions over time, from 1916 through 1986, when JWT
            became a unit of the WPP Group. The newsletter addressed issues of importance to the
            entire company, with articles on account news, client lists--or account gains and
            losses--and biographies and short notes on JWT staff, including professional
            accomplishments, promotions and transfers, visits to other JWT offices, and personal
            events (i.e. marriages, births, and deaths). The series also documents the results of
            both general and client-specific market research surveys, as well as general discussions
            of various markets and industries; television, radio, and print media developments
            (sometimes including listings of programs sponsored by JWT clients); and news from and
            profiles of JWT's offices and divisions around the world. </p>
          <p>There are some gaps in publication of these newsletters, most notably 1931-1945 and
            1970-1975. Coverage of international affairs varies substantially, though all of the
            titles in this series provide some news from JWT's offices overseas. The richest sources
            of JWT international news are the newsletters of the 1970s and 1980s, when there is a
            substantial increase in the frequency and depth of attention paid to JWT operations
            globally. See also the <emph render="bold">International Newsletters Series</emph>. One
            particularly useful source is <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Thumbnail
              Sketches,</title> a column published regularly in the newsletter from 1946 to 1964
            which profiled JWT staff. Also common were reports on JWT advertising campaigns and
            their subsequent impact on both the market and the client; from 1946 until roughly 1962,
            the newsletters featured the <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Campaign of the
              Week,</title> detailing particularly successful campaigns. A listing of <emph
              render="doublequote">Campaign of the Week</emph> topics appears at the end of the
            finding aid.</p>
          <p>The newsletters in this series were all published by the New York office, sometimes
            with local office newsletter inserts (see the <emph render="bold">Domestic Newsletters
              Series: Offices Subseries</emph> and the <emph render="bold">International Newsletter
              Series</emph>); copies of advertisements or management correspondence were sometimes
            attached as well. </p>
          <p> The newsletters are organized chronologically by the date range of publication.
            Folders containing correspondence relating to newsletters precede the listing of
            newsletter titles.</p>

            <p>These booklet-size serial publications share a title with the earlier <title
                type="simple" render="italic">News Bulletin</title>, but otherwise are different
              organs. They were published from 1922 to 1930 for external distribution, and contain
              articles by JWT personnel and outside contributors, primarily on topics of general
              interest to members of the advertising industry. Included are articles about consumer
              motivation, excerpts from market surveys, currentl client lists, and occasional JWT
              staff news. Originally issued monthly, beginning in February 1922, but publication
              became irregular, with no issue for September 1923, and varying numbers of issues for
              subsequent years. Issues are numbered sequentially (numbers 83-141) up to December
              1929. In 1930, the publications's name changed to <title type="simple" render="italic"
                >J. Walter Thompson Bulletin</title>, with new numbering.</p>

          <p>Includes newsletters published by JWT's international offices. Whether or not JWT
            maintained more than one office in a particular country, usually one newsletter covered
            the market news of the whole country or major regions as well as the specific news of
            the offices (for example, <title type="simple" render="italic">The Commodore's
              Log</title> of Canada, reporting from the Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver offices,
            and <title type="simple" render="italic">Boletim JWT</title> of Brazil covering the São
            Paulo and Rio de Janeiro offices). The newsletters are usually in the dominant language
            used by the local office, although some are in English.</p>
          <p>In general, holdings are uneven. The two main periods where the holdings are deepest
            are the late 1950s to the middle of the 1960s and the first half of the 1980s, perhaps
            due to JWT events at the 1964-1965 New York World's Fair and the 1984 Epcot Swap Shop.
            The one nearly complete collection of international newsletters is the run of <title
              type="simple" render="doublequote">Round the Square,</title> published by the London
            office from 1951 to 1986. </p>
          <p>Organized by geographical area in the following order: Canada; Latin America; Europe;
            and Asia/Pacific/Africa. Countries are then listed alphabetically, and then publications
            are listed alphabetically, except for <emph render="doublequote">general</emph>
            publications that cover all of Latin America and all of Europe. These items are found
            under the <emph render="doublequote">General</emph> heading at the beginning of each
            geographical area. </p>
