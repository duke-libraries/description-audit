        America (OAAA) Archives document the operations and activities of the OAAA, the primary
        professional organization throughout the modern history of the outdoor advertising industry
        in the U.S. The collection also includes materials pertaining to the OAAA's predecessor
        organizations such as the Poster Advertising Association, Associated Bill Posters, the
        Painted Outdoor Advertising Association, and the International Bill Poster's Association of
        North America. There is some information on the outdoor industry abroad as well; Canada and
        the England/U.K. are more fully addressed than other countries. Materials include a wide
        variety of media and formats, and include correspondence, directories, published materials
        (such as technical and periodic reports, newsletters and bylaws), membership records, texts
        of speeches, articles and clippings, minutes of association meetings, and industry
        publications such as the long-running serial The Poster.</abstract>

            <event>Philip Tocker, onetime president of the <emph render="bold">Outdoor Advertising
                Association of America</emph>, (OAAA), considered 1870 the line between ancient and
              modern outdoor advertising. This was the year in which the web fed printing press was
              perfected, which made possible poster printing limited only by the size of paper stock
              available. Other technological developments that occurred around 1870 include
              stereotyping, paper-folding machines and a new lithographic halftone printing process.
              Lithography replaced woodcuts as the primary poster printing technique.</event>

            <event>The <emph render="bold">International Bill Posters' Association of North
                America</emph> was formed by a meeting of 11 bill posters in St. Louis, Mo., on
              August 27. They created a charter for the organization and elected their first
              president, John D. Walker. The initial charter set out the ethical standards of the
              organization: to regulate a uniform scale of posting prices, and to act as a watchdog
              against the <emph render="doublequote">malicious covering of bills.</emph> Their goal
              was to upgrade and establish uniform and fair policies for outdoor advertising. It was
              the first national advertising association in the U.S.</event>

            <event>The first state billposting association was formed in Michigan.</event>
            <event>Thomas Cusack, a sign painter, established his business in Chicago. The <emph

            <event>At the Association convention in Pittsburgh, Pa., the <emph render="bold"
                >International Bill Posters' Association of North America</emph> resolved to
              organize state associations. Later that year Ohio bill posters formed a state-wide
              association, but remained independent from the national Association. In 1878, however,
              the <emph render="bold">Ohio Bill Posters' Association</emph> agreed to work in
              harmony with the International Bill Posters' Association of North America.</event>

          <eventgrp>
            <event>After the annual meeting of the International Bill Posters' Association of North
              America in Philadelphia, the association declined, and by 1888 it had disbanded. B.W.
              Robbins started the American Billposting Company, the forerunner of the <emph

          <date>1891</date>
          <eventgrp>
            <event>During this period posters for theater revues and burlesque shows became
              increasingly lurid and provoked public criticisms of outdoor advertising in general.
              In response, around 1891 the national and state associations agreed to refuse to
              handle offensive <emph render="doublequote">paper,</emph> a trade slang term for
              posters and handbills. It was the earliest recorded censorship exercised by an
              advertising medium over copy in the U.S., and marked the beginning of a long practice
              of self-regulation in the outdoor industry.</event>
            <event>The <emph render="bold">Associated Bill Posters Association of United States and
                Canada</emph> (ABPA) was established to promote greater national recognition and
              understanding of the organized poster medium. The ABPA's constitution was influenced
              by that of its predecessor, the <emph render="bold">International Bill Posters'
                Association of North America</emph>. Edward A. Stahlbrodt of Rochester, N.Y. was
              elected as the Association's first president. The following year ABPA would be
              incorporated. The ABPA went through a number of name changes, becoming the <emph
                render="bold">Associated Bill Posters and Distributors Association</emph> (ABPD),
              and then the <emph render="bold">Poster Advertising Association</emph> (PAA). The
              ABPA's inaugural meeting marked the first national convention of outdoor advertising
              professionals.</event>

              with the American Billposting Company that B.W. Robbins began in 1890). Soon after
              that, American Billposting of Brooklyn merged with the T.J. Murphy Company to form the
              Brooklyn Poster Advertising Company, later named the New York Billposting

            <event>On January 8, the <emph render="bold">Inter-State Bill Poster Protective
                Association</emph> was incorporated under Illinois law. In June its name changed to
              the <emph render="bold">International Bill Posting Association</emph> (IBPA). It
              competed with the ABPA for members, although its chief constituency was in the Midwest
              and among small-town posters.</event>
            <event>The ABPA members began work toward establishing uniform structure
              standards.</event>
            <event>The <emph render="bold">Associated Bill Posters Association</emph> (ABPA) first
              published its official organ, <title type="simple" render="italic">The Bill Poster - A

              dedicated to the various media that make up display advertising.</event>
            <event>The <emph render="bold">Associated Bill Posters Association</emph> changed its
              name to the <emph render="bold">Associated Bill Posters of United States and

              president.</event>
            <event>On May 10, the <emph render="bold">New York State Bill Posters'
                Association</emph> adopted a written policy of accountability to advertisers,
              whereby the posting company was required to maintain lists of all locations leased for
              the advertiser, and to maintain the posters in good order for the duration of the
              showing. It is believed that this was the first such policy drafted by a professional
              outdoor advertising organization.</event>

            <event>At their 10th annual convention, the membership of the Associated Bill Posters of
              United States and Canada adopted an <emph render="doublequote">Obligation of
                Honor,</emph> by which each member agreed to uphold a common standard of billposting
              and distributing practice, and to treat each advertiser with complete impartiality.
              One of the consequences of the adoption of this code of ethics was that both
              membership lists and rate schedules came to be printed in The <title type="simple"
                render="italic">Billposter-Display Advertising</title> periodical.</event>
            <event>Standardized billboard structures were developed, which could hold 3, 8 or 16

            <event>The <emph render="bold">Associated Bill Posters' Protective Association</emph>
              was incorporated in New Jersey, the first national sales organization for the outdoor
              industry. Its membership was composed of bill posters from the 40 largest U.S. cities.
              It was designed to circumvent the entry of a capital combine (a corporation of
              financiers and investors who bought and sold companies on speculation, an early form
              of corporate raiders) into the area of outdoor advertising.</event>

              list was arranged alphabetically by state, and showed every city and town where the
              Association's standard of quality and service was guaranteed. The first edition listed
              over 3,000 towns. The membership book also listed the rates that each member agency
              charged per sheet for a normal four-week showing, and the cost per thousand for
              broadside distribution. Finally, the book showed the rating grade assigned to each
              billposter (A = exceeds Association standards, B = meets standards, C = fails to meet
              standards). Generally, the higher rating meant that the billposter could charge higher
              rates for postings, which encouraged all bill posters to improve their quality of
              service.</event>

            <event>The <emph render="bold">Associated Bill Posters and Distributors of the United
                States and Canada</emph> organization adopted a number of other standardized

              arrangement for official salesmen, giving the Association better control over the
              actions of salesmen. The Association also set national standards for outdoor
              advertising and established the numbers of panels sold in each market. For the first
              time, advertisers could evaluate and measure the effectiveness of outdoor advertising.
              The Association began to prescribe the number of locations necessary to give
              advertisers adequate, representative coverage in cities and towns in which their ads
              were displayed.</event>

            <event>The 24-sheet poster standard was adopted; the size was regulated at 8'8" high by

              and a new standard <emph render="doublequote">sheet</emph> measured 28 x 41 inches.
              Sheet sizes had been standardized by lithographers and printers, and were adopted by
              the bill posting firms. Show bills and posters were typically 4 sheets high, and the
              variable widths were based on the number of sheets used. An 8-sheet poster was 4
              sheets high by 2 sheets wide; a 16-sheet poster was 4 by 4; and so on.</event>

            <event>The Associated Bill Posters and Distributors of the United States and Canada

              reflecting concerns that the term <emph render="doublequote">billposter</emph> had
              taken on a negative connotation. By this time, the poster had largely replaced the
              advertising bill as the standard medium of outdoor advertising, and the name change
              also reflected a growing sentiment that the time of the advertising bill had passed,
              and the era of the poster had arrived. Its official publication was called simply
                <title type="simple" render="italic">Association News</title> and continued until
              1926.</event>
            <event>The period 1912-1915 was one of rapid improvements to the quality of poster
              structures, and these structures were modernized and improved. This period of
              investment saw a nearly immediate return, as national posting revenues increased over
              500% in this period. The Association began its policy of rating poster plants and
              posting services, and compiled national lists of plants and services.</event>
            <event>The <emph render="bold">Poster Advertising Association</emph> began to measure
              circulation values offered in different cities, and created a national listing of
              space availability. An agency commission was standardized at 16 2/3 percent.</event>

            <event><emph render="bold">NOAB</emph> was cooperatively owned by 200 of the largest

              effort, the League's appeal was widespread and immediate, and by the end of 1918 its
              rolls had swelled to over 260,000 members drawn from every sector of American business
              and professional life. One of the consequences of the Poster Advertising Company's

            <event><emph render="bold">OAAA</emph> underwent a basic reorganization. The new
              organization was based around state associations, which set the standards for
              membership. Voting procedures changed to allow for one vote per member, as opposed to
              one vote per town. The national Association's primary task was to coordinate the
              activities of the several state associations, and to undertake activities in the
              national arena that would not be economical or practical for state associations. In
              addition, the national Association itself was reorganized into seven divisions:
              Business Development (sales promotion); Education (public relations); Legal
              (government legislation); Plant Development (surveys and research); Membership and
              Statistical (records); Finance and Budget (accounting); and a general Administration
              which coordinated among the divisions.</event>
            <event>At the previous year's (1930) annual convention, the <emph render="bold"
                >OAAA</emph> membership adopted a resolution to preserve and protect the natural

                >Conference on Roadside Business and Natural Beauty</emph> that was held in
              Washington, D.C. in the spring of 1931. Attended by representatives from 33 national
              organizations along with those from the advertising and retail industries, the meeting

            <event>On Dec. 15, after the U.S. had entered World War II, the Executive Committee of

            <event>The <emph render="bold">Outdoor Advertising Foundation</emph> at Notre Dame

            <event>Traffic safety became a major concern. In 1941, the <emph render="bold">National

              Tenn., contributed to a 57% drop in traffic fatalities in its first year. In
              California the campaign was credited with cutting traffic fatalities in Los Angeles in
              half during the period 1946-1949. By 1949 <emph render="doublequote">Operation

            <event>The <emph render="bold">War Advertising Council</emph> was founded as a
              non-profit organization creating public service campaigns in all advertising media.
              The U.S. Office of War Information decided on the particular campaigns to be used to
              support the war effort and boost morale. Then, the War Advertising Council would
              prepare and execute the campaign, and ensure that the outdoor part of the campaign was
              distributed to plant operators.</event>
            <event>On June 1, the first poster supporting the war effort appeared. Perhaps the most
              famous of the Council's campaigns was <emph render="doublequote">Rosie the
                Riveter</emph> who became an icon of wartime support. Throughout the war years, the
              Council produced an estimated $350 million in free public service messages. After the

            <event>Outdoor advertising's <emph render="bold">Postwar Planning Board</emph> held its
              first meeting on February 18, to discuss the return to peacetime activities. Over the
              next several months the Board met on a number of issues. One of the main resolutions
              that came from these meetings was the recommendation to adopt a new standardized
              medium called the Junior Panel. The proposed Junior Panel standard specified a 6-sheet
              poster (1/4 the area of a standard 24-sheet poster) that was intended for
              point-of-purchase advertising at supermarkets and other urban retail establishments.
              Small-format posters of varying sizes had been promoted as "junior" panels for several
              years, and had become popular in urban areas where standard poster sizes proved
              impractical.</event>

            <event>The <emph render="bold">Raymond Loewy</emph>-designed poster panels were adopted
              as a new 24-sheet structure standard. The <emph render="bold">OAAA</emph> originally

              changeover and the scarcity of materials in postwar U.S. forced the <emph

              official panel design, which was adopted at the 1946 annual convention. Loewy panels
              were painted light gray in contrast to the older billboards' dark green. There were no

            <event>The research firm of <emph render="bold">Madigan-Hyland</emph>, in a study of the
              New York Thruway system, found that there were three times as many accidents in
              billboard zones as in billboard-free zones along the Thruway. The controversial study
              increased the friction between proponents and opponents of outdoor advertising, and
              was influential in helping to shape the legislative developments leading to the 1965
                <emph render="bold">Highway Beautification Act</emph>.</event>
            <event>New York State Highway Department officials tore down 53 billboards along the New
              York State Thruway. The billboards were allegedly illegally erected inside the 660 ft.
              right-of-way limit. The <emph render="bold">OAAA</emph> threatened to sue for damages
              on behalf of the billboard operators. The action set off a national debate over
              billboards along the Federal Highway system.</event>
            <event><emph render="bold">Howard Johnson's</emph> became the first advertiser to
              receive the <emph render="bold">OAAA</emph>'s newly established Achievement Award, for
              the chain's <emph render="doublequote">outstanding service to the American motoring
                public.</emph> By the 1960s Howard Johnson's had become the biggest advertiser in
              the restaurant industry, having grown to over 600 restaurants and 153 motor lodges in
              the U.S., which were advertised using over 2,200 painted bulletins and posters. Howard
              Johnson's reached a level of recognition that made the chain synonymous with travel.
              Research conducted in the 1960s revealed that Howard Johnson signs produced over 80%
              recall and remembrance.</event>

            <event>The <emph render="bold">Metropolitan Outdoor Network, Inc.</emph> (MONI) was
              formed to promote outdoor sales in the 50 largest U.S. outdoor markets. This
              organization forced <emph render="bold">OAI</emph> to concentrate on the 300 smaller
              markets, and small market sales, effectively crippling the viability of OAI. An <emph
                render="bold">OAAA</emph> Study Committee, responding to these changes in the
              general outdoor industry's business environment, proposed that <emph render="bold"
                >OAI</emph> become the direct sales arm of the <emph render="bold">OAAA</emph>,
              while the concept-selling and research services of <emph render="bold">OAI</emph> were
              to be spun off into a separate organization. The following year, however, the
              Committee recommended the dissolution of Outdoor Advertising, Inc., <emph
                render="doublequote">in that it had arrived at a point where it was a direct selling
                organization representing too small a segment of the medium.</emph></event>
            <event><emph render="bold">Metromedia</emph>, after purchasing Foster &amp; Kleiser, and

                >Outdoor Advertising, Inc.</emph> (OAI).</event>
            <event>The <emph render="bold">OAAA</emph> prepared a <emph render="bold">Model Highway
                Scenic Area Act</emph> proposal, providing for the establishment of scenic areas by
              law, and regulating and restricting placement of all signs therein. A later proposal
              that year called for overall regulation.</event>
            <event>The <emph render="bold">United Advertising Corp.</emph> (Newark, N.J.) introduced
                <emph render="doublequote">Tandem Rotary</emph> panels. The panels measured 15' high
              by 55' long with a 5'x15' cut-out illustration connecting the 2 panels.</event>

            <event>The <emph render="bold">Outdoor Advertising Institute</emph> was created as an
              autonomous, non-profit organization. It provided an industry-wide, total medium
              program of research and information services intended to better align outdoor with
              other advertising media. Its structure was styled after similar organizations that
              served other advertising media, such as the Bureau of Advertising (newspapers) and the
              Radio Advertising Bureau. Within a month of its formation, the Institute changed its
              name to the <emph render="bold">Institute of Outdoor Advertising</emph> (IOA) to avoid
              acronym confusion with its predecessor, Outdoor Advertising, Inc. The <emph

              reach and frequency figures, new copy pre-testing methods, and other

            <event>National poster sales reached $215 million.</event>
            <event>The <emph render="bold">Highway Beautification Act</emph> was passed by Congress.
              It sought to limit billboards to commercial zones, and away from areas designated as
                <emph render="doublequote">scenic areas.</emph> Billboards were strictly regulated
              along the Interstate and other federally-funded primary highways. Federal laws

      <p>The Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA) Archives arrived at Duke in various
        accessions from both OAAA and from Fairleigh Dickinson University, where a portion of the
        archives was originally housed. An initial container list was created by Technical Services
        staff, covering the largest accession. The over 200 boxes were not internally
        well-organized, with files that fell within the same subject area scattered across a number
        of boxes. The initial container list was used to pre-organize the boxes for intellectual
        arrangement, according to subject areas. These subject areas are reflected in the series
        names listed below, which were created at Duke in order to group related materials
        together.</p>
      <p>The contents of folders were for the most part kept intact and were tranferred to acid free
        folders within acid-free boxes. The information that was included in the initial container
        list was kept with the original folder. That information is included in the container list
        and is demarcated by brackets. Some inconsistency between the information in brackets and
        the contents of the folder may exist since it is possible that some items were removed from
        the folder if they belonged in a more appropriate place.</p>
      <p>The series are organized alphabetically, with the <emph render="bold">Oversize
          Series</emph> listed at the end. In general, material within each series is further
        separated into smaller subseries headings, and organized alphabetically. However, where
        materials reflected events that occurred with periodic regularity (such as meeting minutes)
        or reflected a progressive development over time (such as legislative or legal issues), a
        chronological ordering was used for better context.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, within each series the information on one topic may be divided between letter-
        and legal-size groupings, and each box number also indicates the box size. Oversize items
        from each series have been removed, placed in and listed in the <emph render="bold">Oversize
          Series</emph>. </p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA) Archives</emph>
        document the operations and activities of the OAAA, the primary professional organization
        throughout the modern history of the outdoor advertising industry in the U.S., <unitdate
          era="ce" calendar="gregorian" type="inclusive">1885-1990s</unitdate>. The bulk of material
        falls between 1941 and 1980, that is between the entry of the United States into World War
        II and the end of the 1970s, a period that witnessed rapid and radical changes in the ways
        that Americans viewed and used the outdoors. The collection also includes materials
        pertaining to the OAAA's predecessor organizations such as the Poster Advertising
        Association, Associated Bill Posters, the Painted Outdoor Advertising Association, and the
        International Bill Poster's Association of North America. Some of the major outdoor
        advertising companies and organizations represented in this collection include: General
        Outdoor; Foster &amp; Kleiser; United Advertising; Institute of Outdoor Advertising (IOA);
        National Outdoor Advertising Bureau (NOAB); and Outdoor Advertising, Inc. (OAI). There is
        some information on the outdoor industry abroad as well, especially Canada and the
        England/U.K. Taken as a whole, the collection reflects the activities and concerns (as well
        as the record-keeping practices) of the outdoor advertising industry.</p>
      <p>Although physically organized into 23 series in alphabetical order, the collection may also
        be collocated intellectually into five main themes or topical areas: organization,
        affiliations, operational activities, technical activities, and audio-visual material. These
        broad categories reflect the scope of activities undertaken by the OAAA, the network of
        trade associations, professional organizations, governmental regulatory bodies, material
        manufacturers and engineering societies, and member associates. There is considerable
        overlap among the subjects covered by the various series, so searches of multiple series
        (and/or keyword electronic searches) should be undertaken to obtain a comprehensive view of
        the collection.</p>
      <p>Included in the collection are multiple-format materials: paper files, printed materials,
        photographs, slides, blueprints, placards and metal signage. Other materials are a wide
        variety of media and formats, such as correspondence, directories, published materials (such
        as technical and periodic reports, newsletters and bylaws), membership records, texts of
        speeches, articles and clippings, minutes of association meetings, and industry publications
        such as the long-running serial <title type="simple" render="italic">The Poster</title>. The
        numerous photographs scattered in files have been given index numbers and have been replaced
        in the files by photocopies so the originals may be better preserved and more accessible for
        browsing. The original images are located in the <emph render="bold">Photographs and
          Negatives Series</emph>, and are organized by index numbers. A searchable online database,
          <emph render="bold">Resource of Outdoor Advertising Descriptions (ROAD)</emph>, contains
        descriptions of these images.</p>
      <p>Researchers interested in the organization of the OAAA might begin with the following
        series: <emph render="bold">Administration--Officers</emph>; <emph render="bold">Budget /
          Finance</emph>; <emph render="bold">Constitution &amp; Bylaws</emph>; <emph render="bold"
          >History</emph>; <emph render="bold">Meetings</emph>; <emph render="bold"
          >Organization--Committees</emph>; and <emph render="bold">Organization--Departments and
          Divisions</emph>. These series document the overall organizational structure and
        operations of the OAAA, its board, committees and departments, as well as the record of its
        activities as reflected in meeting minutes, budgets, and its governing bylaws and policies.
        The OAAA was organized as a corporation, with a president and key officers elected from the
        Association membership. A Chairman's Advisory Committee assisted the Association leadership.
        Prominent officers represented in the collection include Frank Cawl, Karl Ghaster, and
        Walter Holan. Below that, the OAAA followed a dual <emph render="doublequote">line and
          staff</emph> organizational structure in which functions and activities determined the
        range of departmental divisions, and each division was overseen by an administrative
        committee which carried the same name as the division or department. Key divisions within
        the Association include the Public Policy, Research and Engineering, Business Development,
        and Plant Development divisions.</p>
      <p>Material pertaining to the industry affiliations of the outdoor advertising industry is
        contained in the following series: <emph render="bold">History</emph>, <emph render="bold"
          >International</emph>, <emph render="bold">Membership</emph>, <emph render="bold">Notre
          Dame</emph>, <emph render="bold">Outdoor Advertising Companies</emph>, <emph render="bold"
          >Publications</emph>, <emph render="bold">State Associations</emph>, and <emph
          render="bold">Trade Organizations</emph>. This theme includes the regional and state
        outdoor advertising associations, along with the outdoor advertising companies that
        comprised the membership of the OAAA. Prominent among these are the General Outdoor
        Advertising Co., Foster &amp; Kleiser Company, the R.C. Maxwell Company, John Donnelly and
        Sons, the Thomas Cusack Company, Columbus Outdoor, and United Advertising. In addition, the
        collection documents the activities of a number of professional organizations linked to
        outdoor advertising, such as the Association of National Advertisers, the Associated
        Advertising Clubs of America, the Advertising Federation of America, the American
        Association of Advertising Agencies, the American Advertising Federation, the National
        Outdoor Advertising Bureau, Outdoor Advertising, Inc., the Institute of Outdoor Advertising,
        the International Congress of Outdoor Advertising, and Notre Dame University's School of
        Outdoor Advertising.</p>
      <p>The operational activities of the outdoor industry are documented mainly in the following
        series: <emph render="bold">Campaign Case Studies</emph>, <emph render="bold">Issues and
          Activities</emph>, <emph render="bold">Local Markets</emph>, and <emph render="bold"
          >Regulation</emph>. These activities included sales, industry promotion and education, the
        monitoring of legislation and public policy affecting outdoor advertising, and public
        service campaigns. Operational activities linked the OAAA and outdoor advertising to the
        larger world, through such programs as patriotic and public service campaigns, as well as
        advocacy and promotional efforts through trade and general-audience publications. In
        addition, these files document the OAAA's participation in the public debate over issues
        directly concerning outdoor advertising, such as zoning ordinances, advertising regulation,
        and visual aesthetics. There are files on research firms and researchers such as A.C.
        Nielsen, Bruskin Associates, General Media, John Paver and Wilbur Smith. These series show
        the interactions between the OAAA and both governmental and non-governmental agencies and
        interest groups, such as the American Automobile Association, the National Safety Council,
        the Advertising Council (and its precursor the War Advertising Council), and the General
        Federation of Women's Clubs, as well as some notable individual activists such as Elizabeth
        Lawton. The materials in these files show the relationships, sometimes oppositional but
        frequently collaborative, between these agencies and the OAAA, over topics that included
        legislation and litigation over the regulation of outdoor advertising (at state and local as
        well as at the federal level) displays (posters, signs, and billboards), patriotism
        (especially during World War II), the energy crisis, urban renewal, zoning ordinances, the
        Highway Beautification Act (pursuant to the Federal Highway Acts), and highway and traffic
        safety. Also included in the series in this topical area are case studies of a wide range of
        outdoor advertising campaigns, involving such client companies as the Kellogg Company, Ford
        Motor Company, the Morton Salt Company, Swift and Co., and the Clark Candy Company (now
        owned by New England Confectionery Company). In addition, the OAAA and its membership
        conducted advertising campaigns designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the outdoor
        medium, using famous figures such as Calvin Coolidge, Woodrow Wilson, Miss America Shirley
        Cothran, and even with a fictitious automobile, the <emph render="doublequote">Testa</emph>
        car.</p>
      <p>Technologies and research-related activities involved in outdoor advertising are
        represented in the series: <emph render="bold">Audience / Readership</emph>; <emph
          render="bold">Physical Structure</emph>; <emph render="bold">Research</emph>; and <emph
          render="bold">Traffic Audit Bureau</emph>. These series address those activities that
        comprise the production and display of outdoor advertising, such as billboard structure
        standards; research on paint, paper and glue; illumination; sign legibility; layout and
        typography; and posting practices. These files include materials on advertising reception
        and recall, traffic counts and other market-related research. Research aimed at improving
        the efficiency of outdoor advertising includes studies of billboard and poster placement,
        standardized sizes of billboards and posters, legibility studies, the development of market
        research methodologies, and the audits of individual poster plants to ensure industry-wide
        standard practices. In addition, the OAAA engaged in ongoing research into the technical
        aspects of manufacturing and posting outdoor advertising displays, through studies of
        billboard structure construction and engineering, building and plant maintenance,
        landscaping, paint and color research, paper, glue, illumination techniques and standards,
        the formation and modification of building codes and code compliance, and workplace safety.
        These activities involved ongoing relationships between the OAAA and a number of research
        and engineering agencies and associations, such as the A.C. Nielsen Company (readership
        studies), the Simmons Market Research Bureau, Wilbur Smith and Associates, the Barney Link
        Fellowship (academic research), the Traffic Audit Bureau (a nationwide organization based in
        N.Y.), Raymond Loewy Associates (developer of the Loewy panels), the Tiffen Art Metal Co.
        (all-metal billboard structures), Bruskin Associates (foot-traffic research), Daniel Starch
        and Staff, and Axiom (market research).</p>

      <p><emph render="bold">Glossary of Key Terms Used in Outdoor Advertising</emph>
      </p>
      <p>NOTE: Trade terms in the glossary text in boldface indicate that those terms also have an
        entry in this glossary. </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">3-Sheet Poster</emph>: A poster measuring 6' high by 3' wide, usually
        found along the outer walls of retail stores.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">6-Sheet Poster</emph>: A poster measuring 4'4" x 9'10", usually found
        near retail stores. This was originally the size meant by the term <emph render="bold"
          >Junior Poster</emph>
      </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">8-Sheet Poster</emph>: A poster format measuring 6' x 12' overall with
        a bleed area of 5' x 11'. The 8-sheet posters are prominent features around retail
        establishments, and are widely used for advertising around neighborhoods. They also gained
        popularity among farm equipment suppliers for economical and seasonal reminder advertising.
        They are also currently known as <emph render="bold">Junior Posters</emph>.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">24-Sheet Poster</emph>: The most widely used poster size in North
        America, and what most people mean when they refer to <title type="simple"
          render="doublequote"><emph render="bold">billboards</emph>.</title> These posters have a
        copy area measuring 8'8" high by 19'6" wide.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">30-Sheet Poster</emph>: The largest standard poster size, measuring
        12'3" x 24'6" overall with a bleed area of 10'5" x 22'8".</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Allotments</emph>: The number of <emph render="bold">poster
          panels</emph> that make up a <emph render="bold">showing</emph>.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Animation</emph>: Devices or techniques used to create the illusion of
        movement in a poster or bulletin display. Animation may be mechanical, like a moving
        armature or figure, or it may be achieved with lighting patterns. The famous Coca-Cola
        spectacular at Times Square, for example, uses programmed lights to create the illusion that
        the Coke bottle regularly fills and empties.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Approach</emph>: In a line of travel, the distance from which an
        advertising structure first becomes fully visible to the point where the copy is no longer
        readable (having passed out of sight). Sometimes descriptive terms are used, such as Flash
        Approach, Short Approach, Medium Approach, or Long Approach, which also indicate the
        relative duration that an advertising structure remains visible to a potential reader in
        traffic.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Flash Approach</emph>: For pedestrian traffic, it refers to an approach
        distance of under 40'; for vehicles an approach of under 75' (for vehicles moving under 30
        miles per hour) to under 100' (for vehicles moving over 30 mph).</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Short Approach</emph>: For pedestrian traffic, an approach distance
        between 40'-75'; for vehicles an approach distance from 75'-150' (under 30 miles per hour)
        to 100'-200' (over 30 mph).</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Medium Approach</emph>: For pedestrian traffic, an approach distance
        between 75'-125'; for vehicles an approach distance from 150'-250' (under 30 miles per hour)
        to 200'-350' (over 30 mph).</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Long Approach</emph>: For pedestrian traffic, an approach distance
        greater than 125'; for vehicles an approach from over 250' (under 30 miles per hour) to over
        350' (over 30 mph).</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC)</emph>: An independent auditing
        organization that conducts advertising and readership research, primarily in newspapers and
        magazines. It was founded in 1914, and continues its research mission today. The pre-eminent
        print media research organization in the world, it served as the model for the <emph
          render="bold">Traffic Audit Bureau</emph>. In fact, TAB was conceived to provide the same
        kinds of service to the outdoor advertising industry that ABC provided for the print
        industry.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Audited Circulation</emph>: The <emph render="bold">Traffic Audit
          Bureau (TAB)</emph> investigates and determines the <emph render="bold">circulation</emph>
        for a given advertising location, based on procedures generally accepted by the business
        community. The <emph render="bold">Audit Bureau of Circulations</emph> is another
        independent reporting firm that provides similar research services.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Awareness</emph>: The degree to which one remembers having seen a
        particular ad in a test market.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Billboard</emph>: A generic term that refers to any large outdoor
        advertising sign. These may be any of the many multiple-sheet posters, <emph render="bold"
          >painted bulletins</emph>, wall murals, stadium signs, and so on. However, in popular use,
        the term billboard refers to the standard <emph render="bold">24-sheet poster</emph>, along
        with its physical structure, which became a ubiquitous part of the American roadside
        architecture. The outdoor industry dropped "billboard" as a technical term in the early
        1930s, due to negative connotations, but the word has persisted in the popular vocabulary of
        the American public to this day.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Blanked ad</emph>: In a recall or awareness study, portions of a
        poster's <emph render="bold">copy</emph>, usually the advertiser's name, brand name, or
        marketing slogan, are covered and hidden from view. Respondents are asked if they can
        identify the ad despite the missing or covered copy elements.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Blanking</emph>: The white paper border surrounding poster <emph
          render="bold">copy</emph>.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Bleed Area</emph>: Bleed is when printed images run all the way to the
        edge of the page, as opposed to standard printing which leaves a white border around the
        image. Bleeds are usually printed larger than the finished image (called trim size). The
        part of the printed image's margin that is trimmed away to achieve a final size is called
        the bleed area. It differs from cropping, in which a part of the actual image is
        removed.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Bleed-Through</emph>: A situation where previous advertising <emph
          render="bold">copy</emph> can be seen though present copy. Also called <emph
          render="doublequote">show-through.</emph>
      </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Blister</emph>: Air pockets that sometimes form between the sheets of a
        poster and the posting surface.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Circulation</emph>: The traffic volume at a given location; it is
        synonymous with <emph render="bold">traffic</emph>. Circulation refers to the circulation of
        people in an urban landscape. Beginning in 1912, the outdoor advertising industry became
        increasingly concerned with the growing urban concentration of people, the patterns of
        circulation of people, and the challenge of locating advertising structures at points of
        maximum circulation. </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Cooperative Account</emph>: An outdoor advertising campaign in which
        both the manufacturer and the distributor of a product share the costs of advertising.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Copy</emph>: The pictorial design, background, and message combined in
        a display on a poster or bulletin. Copy refers to all of the elements that go into a
        billboard design, not just the textual message. </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Counting Station</emph>: A specific point along a traffic artery where
        vehicles are counted in order to determine traffic volume.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Coverage</emph>: The placement of an outdoor advertising message on a
        network of principal thoroughfares so that the advertiser's message reaches as many people,
        as often as possible, throughout a given display period.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Cut-Outs</emph>: Figures or mechanical devices that are attached to a
        poster structure to create a 3-dimensional effect. </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Daily Effective Circulation (DEC)</emph>: The size of the audience that
        has the opportunity to see a given advertising message in a 24-hour period. It is the least
        number of people counted in the <emph render="bold">Daily Gross Circulation (DGC)</emph> who
        have a reasonable opportunity to see an advertising display. The basic formula is: 50% of
        pedestrian DGC traffic; 50% of motor vehicle traffic; and 25% of mass transportation
        traffic.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Daily Gross Circulation (DGC)</emph>: The total number of persons who
        pass by a given set of panels (a representative showing) in a given day.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Daily Impressions</emph>: Another term for <emph render="bold">Daily
          Effective Circulation</emph>; an estimate of the number of people who pass by a given
        outdoor ad.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Display Period</emph>: The duration of an advertising display, as
        stipulated in a posting contract.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">District Showing</emph>: A showing where posters are displayed in only
        a portion of a market (hence the term <emph render="doublequote">district</emph>), rather
        than in the whole market.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Effective Circulation</emph>: The potential audience for a given
        advertising structure.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Electric Spectacular</emph>: A flashing or neon lighted display
        generally seen at points of high congestion or at tourist attractions. New York City's Times
        Square; the Boardwalk at Atlantic City, New Jersey; and the strip in Las Vegas are examples
        of sites famous for their large concentrations of dramatic spectaculars.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Extension</emph>: Another term for <emph render="bold">cutout</emph>;
        additional copy beyond the panel face of a bulletin or billboard.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Face</emph>: The surface area of an outdoor advertising structure.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Facing</emph>: The side of an advertising structure visible to traffic
        flow.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Flagging</emph>: A tear on a poster, which causes it to hang loose,
        like a flag.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Frequency</emph>: The number of times a person has a chance to see a
        given advertising message during a <emph render="bold">showing</emph> period.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Gross Rating Points (GRP)</emph>: The total number of <emph
          render="bold">impressions</emph> delivered by a <emph render="bold">showing</emph>. GRP
        are figured by dividing the <emph render="bold">Daily Effective Circulation (DEC)</emph> by
        the market population.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Hoarding</emph>: An early word for <emph render="bold"
        >billboard</emph>. Originally, a hoarding, from the Old French word for "fence," referred to
        the fencing placed around construction sites. Its association with advertising came from the
        fact that such fences were handy posting surfaces for bill posters. Eventually fences, along
        with large wall-like structures, were erected specifically for advertising purposes along
        roadways. Modern billboards represent the culmination of historical efforts to control the
        placement of outdoor advertising as well as to regulate the size and configuration of
        posting surfaces, in an effort to address concerns and complaints raised by hoardings and
        the specter of "billboard blight."</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Identification</emph>: Identification occurs when a respondent
        identifies an advertiser in a blanked ad during an <emph render="bold"
        >awareness</emph>/recognition study.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Illuminated Bulletin</emph>: Posters or bulletins equipped with
        electric lighting, generally used in areas with high traffic volume day and night.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Impression</emph>: A term used to indicate the number of people who
        have an opportunity to see an ad in a given period of time.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Intensity</emph>: The size of a poster <emph render="bold"
          >showing</emph>, or the extent to which an advertiser's message is displayed in a <emph
          render="bold">market</emph>. Intensity is usually represented in terms of an index number,
        such as #100, #50, and so on. See the entry for <emph render="bold">showing</emph> for
        further explanation.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Junior Panel</emph>: The posting structure measuring 6'x8', designed to
        accommodate <emph render="bold">Junior Posters</emph>.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Junior Poster</emph>: Junior posters are smaller versions of standard
          <emph render="bold">24-sheet poster</emph> billboards that maintained the billboard's
        1:2.25 height-width proportions but included only 1/4 the overall dimensions and surface
        area. They were commonly referred to as <emph render="bold">6-sheet posters</emph>, although
        the standard officially adopted by the OAAA was technically a 6-1/2 sheet size. By the 1970s
        the term <emph render="doublequote">Junior Poster</emph> was interchangable with the term
          <emph render="bold">8-sheet poster</emph>. They were originally conceived to reinforce and
        supplement standard-sized poster campaigns, but developed a niche in urban areas, around
        retail establishments, and in sites where zoning laws limited the use of larger posting
        structures.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Length of Approach</emph>: The measured distance from which a painted
        bulletin or poster is clearly visible.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Line of Travel</emph>: The centerline of an approach road.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Lithography</emph>: A technique for reproducing images in the mass
        production of posters. In lithography, the design is transferred onto stone or metal plates
        which are inked and printed onto paper. </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Load Factor</emph>: In a traffic study, the average number of occupants
        in a vehicle.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Location List</emph>: A list of the locations of all poster panels sold
        and delivered.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Mandatory Copy</emph>: Ad copy that is required by law to appear on
        advertising of certain products. It includes warnings, labeling requirements, and
        disclaimers.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Market</emph>: A market is generally considered in terms of a local
        consumer area, typically a town or municipality. Traffic research has shown that typically
        20 percent of a town's roads carry 80 percent of its traffic, within each market. Therefore,
        roughly equal sections of major traffic arteries are divided into <emph render="bold">poster
          zones</emph>, which determine the intensity of a poster display campaign, called a poster
          <emph render="bold">showing</emph>.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Minimum Showing</emph>: The smallest number of poster panels that an
        advertiser can purchase without paying a per-panel rate premium.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Mobile Panel</emph>: An advertising panel mounted on a trailer that can
        be transported to a given site. It is usually used for merchandising purposes or event
        advertising.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Molding</emph>: The frame made of wood, metal or plastic, which
        surrounds the <emph render="bold">face</emph> of an advertising structure. Also called <emph
          render="doublequote">trim.</emph>
      </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">M.O.V.I.</emph>: Metro Outdoor Visibility Index. A pre-testing
        technique that allows an advertiser to evaluate the effectiveness of an outdoor message
        design by simulating the environment in which the message will appear.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Net Advertising Circulation (NAC)</emph>: The <emph render="bold">Daily
          Effective Circulation (DEC)</emph> of a showing, modified by the poster structures' <emph
          render="bold">Space Position Value (SPV)</emph>. To arrive at the NAC of a showing, the
        average NAC of all illuminated panels in a <emph render="bold">poster plant</emph> is
        multiplied by the number of illuminated panels in a showing. The same procedure is followed
        for the un-illuminated panels in a showing, and the NAC is the sum of the two figures.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Off-Premise Sign</emph>: A sign that advertises a product or service
        away from the location where it is made or provided.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">On-Premise Sign</emph>: A sign that advertises a product or service at
        the location where it is made, sold or provided.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Outdoor Advertising</emph>: Refers to all advertising encountered
        out-of-doors. The OAAA currently recognizes four broad categories of outdoor advertising:
          <emph render="bold">billboards</emph>, <emph render="bold">street furniture</emph>, and
          <emph render="bold">transit advertising</emph> as well as alternative media, which
        includes advertising sites such as stadiums, airborne advertising, and gas pumps.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Outdoor Travel</emph>: The number and percentage of people who go
        outdoors in a given day. </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Out of Home</emph>: A catch-all phrase that refers to all forms of
        advertising that reach consumers primarily outside his or her home.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Painted Bulletin</emph>: Bulletins differ from posters in a number of
        ways. Bulletin structures tend to be larger than poster boards; the standard bulletin
        structure measures 14' x 48', or twice the width of a standard poster panel. Also, bulletins
        generally occupy the most desirable locations along major roadways. While <emph
          render="bold">poster panels</emph> or sheets are typically mechanically reproduced by
        lithograph or other means, painted bulletins are painted, frequently by hand, and each
        bulletin tends to be in some way unique. Painted bulletins share a common history with the
        arts of sign-painting, lettering and calligraphy. The term <emph render="doublequote"
          >painted bulletin</emph> also refers to notices and advertisements painted on walls and
        roofs, as well as signs and notices painted on barns along rural roadways. Painted bulletins
        frequently feature special <emph render="bold">cutouts</emph> that alter the appearance of
        the structure. They tend to be more expensive than posters, due not only to the desirability
        of their locations but also to the labor required in their execution and maintenance.
        Painted bulletins are generally leased for <emph render="bold">showings</emph> that last a
        year. </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Porta-Panel</emph>: Full-sized poster panels erected for indoor
        events.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Plant Capacity</emph>: The total number of #100 showings (see the
        explanation under <emph render="bold">Showing</emph>) that are available in a <emph
          render="bold">poster plant</emph>.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Plant Operator</emph>: A company or individual who operates or
        maintains outdoor advertising structures.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Poster Panel</emph>: A structure used to display either <emph
          render="bold">24- or 30-sheet posters</emph>. It measures 12' high by 24' wide. Also
        called a <emph render="bold">billboard</emph>.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Poster Plant</emph>: A poster plant consists of all the bulletin
        structures in a single urban area controlled by a single advertising company. The
        establishment of poster plant standardized operations, construction, maintenance and quality
        control has been an integral part of the OAAA's activities since its inception. The ultimate
        goal is for all poster plants to deliver the same quality of service to advertisers,
        limiting the difference only to the quality of the location of a plant's advertising
        structures. </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Posting Date</emph>: The date on which the posters of a <emph
          render="bold">showing</emph> are scheduled for display.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Pounce Pattern</emph>: A poster pattern is projected onto large sheets
        of paper and traced in outline form. The outline is then perforated with a needle, and the
        perforated designs are known as a pounce pattern. Dust is blown through the perforations,
        which creates a pattern on the posting <emph render="bold">face</emph>, ready for painting.
        Prior to computerized graphic design techniques, it was a common practice for transferring
        and enlarging <emph render="bold">copy</emph> art.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Premiere Panel</emph>: A standard display, measuring 12'3" x 24'6"
        overall. Typically, premiere panels are single sheet vinyl panels stretched over a 30-sheet
        poster panel structure.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Rain Lap</emph>: The practice of lapping <emph render="bold">poster
          panel</emph> sections, so that the upper sections overlap the lower sections, similar to
        shingles. Rain lap panels reduce <emph render="bold">flagging</emph> and rain seepage.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Rates</emph>: Beginning in 1901 Associated Bill Posters inaugurated the
        practice of publishing the rates of its member agencies in an effort to promote a standard
        of service across the outdoor advertising profession. The rates were listed in terms of the
        cost per sheet, a number which had to be multiplied by the number of sheets required for
        each <emph render="bold">poster</emph>, and by the number of postings in a <emph
          render="bold">showing</emph>. Thus, a listed rate of 12 cents (.12) meant that for example
        in Minneapolis, where a properly representative showing required 80 24-sheet or 150 8-sheet
        posters, the typical cost (in 1900) of a showing would be $144.00 for an 8-sheet display
        (150 x 8 x .12), or $230.40 for a 24-sheet display (80 x 24 x .12). </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Reach</emph>: The approximate percentage of a target audience
        population that will be potentially exposed to an advertising message at least once during a
          <emph render="bold">showing</emph> period.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Readership-Remembrance</emph>: The number and percentage of people who
        remember having seen a given poster.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Riding a Showing</emph>: A physical field inspection of the panels used
        in a <emph render="bold">showing</emph>.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Roadside Signs</emph>: A collective term for all signage found along
        roadsides. Roadside signage falls into 2 basic categories: commercial (both on-premise and
        off-premise) and governmental (right-of-way signage, including traffic markers, warning
        signs, and historic markers).</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Rotary Bulletin</emph>: A standard 14' x 48' bulletin structure that
        can be moved (<emph render="doublequote">rotated</emph>) to different locations at fixed
        intervals. </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Setback</emph>: The distance from the <emph render="bold">line of
          travel</emph> to the center of an advertising structure.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Showing</emph>: A <emph render="doublequote">package</emph> of poster
        displays. A showing generally lasts for 30 days, and is categorized numerically in terms of
          <emph render="bold">intensity</emph>, and generally noted as either <emph render="italic"
          >#50</emph> or <emph render="italic">#100</emph> showings. A <emph render="italic">#50
          showing</emph> includes one poster display for every <emph render="bold">poster
          zone</emph> (a section of a local <emph render="bold">market</emph>), a <emph
          render="italic">#100 showing</emph> includes 2 posters, and so on. The numerical index
        ensures that each poster campaign will receive an adequate distribution, and each advertiser
        will receive equal treatment by the posting firm. Traditionally, showings were referred to
        in terms of a full- (#100), half- (#50), or quarter- (#25) showing, but by the 1920s, the
        terms had changed to: intensive, representative, and minimum.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">S.M.S.A.</emph>: Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area. An
        economically integrated area consisting of a central city and its contiguous counties.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Snipe</emph>: An adhesive strip used to change a portion of the <emph
          render="bold">copy</emph> of a bulletin. Also called <emph render="doublequote"
          >overlay.</emph>
      </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Space Position Value (SPV)</emph>: The index of visibility of a <emph
          render="bold">poster</emph> panel. SPV is based on four factors: length of <emph
          render="bold">approach</emph>, speed of travel, angle of the panel to approach, and the
        relationship of the panel to adjacent panels.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Spotted Map</emph>: A map showing the locations of the panels used in a
        given poster <emph render="bold">showing</emph>.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Stock Posters</emph>: Standardized poster designs that may be purchased

        given point, called a <emph render="bold">counting station</emph>, in order to determine the
          <emph render="bold">daily effective circulation</emph> of a location.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Transit Advertising</emph>: Advertising messages intended to reach
        users of non-personal transportation. Transit advertising includes taxi-cab tops, bus sides
        and interior panels, subway cars, and airport and railway posters.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Transit Shelter</emph>: A curbside structure located at bus and trolley
        stops. Transit shelters provide standardized advertising spaces measuring 69x48" with a
        bleed area of 67x46".</p>

          <p>The series includes biographical files on key OAAA officials; the personal files of
            several OAAA executives; as well as extensive files that have been identified as
            belonging to Frank Cawl, Karl Ghaster, and Walter Holan. These latter files contain
            personal correspondence, notes from committee meetings and planning sessions, as well as
            texts for speeches and presentations; they are of special interest to researchers
            interested in the wide range of activities undertaken by OAAA executives in the course
            of daily operations, and they provide a glimpse into the corporate culture of the OAAA
            at different times.</p>
          <p>Biographies are first, followed by materials arranged alphabetically by officer name or
            category. Letter size folders are followed by legal size folders in two runs.</p>

          <p>The series highlights one of the key areas of concern to the outdoor advertising
            industry, that of ensuring that their efforts to advertise actually reached potential
            consumers. Included here are numerous studies on a wide range of products and campaigns,
            for such varied products as Kellogg's, Ford, Morton Salt, and Swift meats. These studies
            focused on audience reception of outdoor advertising campaigns, testing variables such
            as reach and frequency, copy identification, recall and remembrance of advertising
            messages. While most of these studies used actual campaigns, some test campaigns were
            developed specifically for research use, like Calvin Coolidge (Hooper), Woodrow Wilson
            (Turner Advertising) and the fictional <emph render="doublequote">Testa</emph>
            automobile (OAI). In addition to the studies and research reports, the series also
            includes reports on market segmentation (like the youth market) and analyses of research
            methodologies. These materials are important to the understanding of how the outdoor
            industry perceived the marketplace during a period of rapid change within American
            consumer culture.</p>

          <p>The series includes accounting records, budget manuals and financial reports, along
            with studies of the practice of accounting itself within the outdoor advertising
            industry. While the series does feature a wide range of materials relating to
            accounting, the account records themselves are not continuous over long periods of time.
            As such, the materials collected here are of research interest perhaps more for the
            types of accounting records maintained at various times than for the actual accounting
            data retained.</p>
          <p>Arranged alphabetically. Letter size folders are followed by legal size folders in two
            runs.</p>
          <p>[NOTE: Some large materials have been removed to the Oversize Materials Series. A
            Listing may be found at the end of this container list.]</p>

            journal article profiles or of trade publication broadsides, like the OAAA's <emph
              render="doublequote">Copy Ideas</emph> series. There are, however, a few extensive
            campaign studies contained here, such as the Clark candy bar study, a huge marketing
            research study undertaken in the early 1980s.</p>
          <p>Arranged alphabetically by product type. Letter size folders are followed by legal size
            folders in two runs.</p>
          <p>[NOTE: Some large materials have been removed to the Oversize Materials Series. A
            Listing may be found at the end of this container list.]</p>

          <p>The series includes the constitutions, bylaws, resolutions and other materials related
            to the basic organization and function of the various trade organizations in the outdoor
            industry. Read consecutively, the constitutions provide insights into the original
            vision of an outdoor advertising trade association, the concerns of the founders, and
            the ways that the association by-laws have both changed and remained the same over the
            past 100 years of organized outdoor advertising.</p>
          <p>Arranged alphabetically by trade association. Letter size folders are followed by legal
            size folders in two runs.</p>

          <p>The series collects materials relating to the historical development of outdoor
            advertising, as well as the treatment of outdoor advertising as history, through its
            incorporation into various archives. Much of the material collected here was identified
            as being of historical interest by OAAA officials over time, including speeches,
            articles, clippings, photos and publications of the predecessors to the OAAA (such as
            the Associated Bill Posters and Distributors, and the Poster Advertising Association).
            Other items that trace the roots of organized outdoor advertising, providing it with a
            sense of history and historical importance, are also included.</p>
          <p>[NOTE: Some large materials have been removed to the Oversize Materials Series. A
            Listing may be found at the end of this container list.]</p>
          <p>Arranged alphabetically by topic. Letter size folders are followed by legal size

          <p>The series contains files on a wide range of outdoor advertising companies,
            associations and expositions around the world. Most of the material is dated in the
            1970s and 1980s, and serves to provide more of a sense of the global reach of outdoor
            advertising than an in-depth understanding. Canada and England are the most heavily
            represented countries in this series, but there are also limited materials on the
            outdoor industry elsewhere in the world.</p>
          <p>Arranged alphabetically by country. Letter size folders are followed by legal size
            folders in two runs.</p>
          <p>[NOTE: Some large materials have been removed to the Oversize Materials Series. A
            Listing may be found at the end of this container list.]</p>

          <p>The series covers a range of activities that involved the OAAA and the outdoor
            industry. The main topics include building maintenance, press, public service, sales and
            World War II-era wartime activities. Significant files include those concerning the
            energy crisis of the 1970s, showing how the U.S. government mandates to reduce energy
            consumption impacted the outdoor industry in a variety of ways, from restrictions on
            illuminated signage to gasoline rationing and speed limit reductions. Other important
            sections in this series include files on association reorganization plans, the
            relationship between the outdoor industry and public service associations, outdoor sales
            promotion, and support of World War II.</p>
          <p>Arranged alphabetically by topic. Letter size folders are followed by legal size
            folders in two runs.</p>

          <p>The series contains different types of outdoor advertising research studies that focus
            on specific areas, towns, regions, or communities, or demographic groups. The local
            focus was a distinctive feature of the outdoor industry, which until the late twentieth
            century was structured by an extensive network of relatively small firms that served a
            specific regional market. These studies are significant not only because they represent
            the local aspect of the outdoor industry's culture, but also because they connect
            research methodologies and specific advertising campaigns to real markets and sites.</p>
          <p>Arranged alphabetically by state. Letter size folders are followed by legal size
            folders in two runs.</p>

          <p>The series includes the minutes from national organizational and committee meetings,
            conference proceedings, reports and recommendations presented at national conventions,
            as well as a file of clippings and report summaries. Major categories are Annual
            Meetings, Directors' Meetings, Executive Committee Meetings, Officers' Meetings, and
            Reports. In addition to the OAAA, the International Congress of Outdoor Advertising and
            the meetings of the Institute of Outdoor Advertising are also represented in this
            series. The conference proceedings capture some of the culture and ongoing work of the
            outdoor advertising profession. Meeting minutes reflect personal experiences with
            individual case histories of products as well as the professional experiences and
            pressing concerns of the association membership.</p>
          <p>Arranged alphabetically by category. Each category is further subdivided either
            chronologically or alphabetically. Letter size folders are followed by legal size
            folders in two runs. Detailed information in the folder listings reflect text that was
            on original folders.</p>
          <p>[NOTE: Some large materials have been removed to the Oversize Materials Series. A
            Listing may be found at the end of this container list.]</p>

          <p>The series includes application forms, files and correspondence on dues, memoranda to
            members, and membership records. The membership files are incomplete; however, it is
            possible in some cases to trace some aspects of an advertising company's history through
            the membership records, as these list not only the key officers of the company, but also
            changes in ownership and the sizes of the market covered by the company.</p>
          <p>Arranged alphabetically by topic. Letter size folders are followed by legal size
            folders in two runs.</p>
          <p>[NOTE: Some large materials have been removed to the Oversize Materials Series. A
            Listing may be found at the end of this container list.]</p>

          <p>The series documents the long relationship between the OAAA and the University of Notre
            Dame. Beginning in the early 1940s, the outdoor industry sought to establish a school to
            train young professionals for careers in outdoor advertising. Notre Dame was the site
            for the first outdoor advertising educational program and the first university to offer
            a degree in outdoor advertising. The series includes correspondence between OAAA and
            Notre Dame leading to the establishment of the School of Outdoor Advertising, as well as
            contribution rolls, program information, and research reports produced at Notre Dame for
            the outdoor industry.</p>
          <p>Arranged alphabetically by topic. Letter size folders are followed by legal size

          <p>The series contains the files and records of the committees that formed within the OAAA
            staff organizational structure. Some of the committees were short-lived and created for
            a specific purpose (like the Home Ownership Committee), while others were fundamental to
            the operation of the OAAA and survived for decades (such as the Chairman's Advisory
            Committee). The series provides an overview of the organizational structure of OAAA
            management and staff operations. In general, the committees provided oversight for and
            set the basic policies for the departments and divisions. Researchers interested in the
            operational aspects of the OAAA should consult both the files relating to a particular
            committee as well as those that pertain to related departments. </p>

            <p>This was a task committee set up to study OAAA's overall organizational structure,
              and proposed ways to streamline the organizational chain. The committee was
              responsible for, among other things, the creation of the Chairman's Advisory Committee
              as a standing committee with executive authority, and was the originator of the
              proposal to merge OAAA with OAI (which finally took place in the 1970s).</p>

          <p>The series contains the files and records of the departments and divisions that made up
            the OAAA's operational structure. The series provides an overview of the organizational
            structure of OAAA line operations; the department names reflect the primary concerns of
            the association: business development, plant operations, education, painted displays,
            poster plant development, public policy, and research and engineering. As with most
            firms organized by line and staff, the departments carried out the policies identified
            and articulated by the committees. Researchers interested in the operational aspects of
            the OAAA should consult both the files relating to a particular committee as well as
            those that pertain to related departments.</p>
          <p>Arranged alphabetically by department or division name. Letter size folders are
            followed by legal size folders in two runs.</p>
          <p>[NOTE: Some large materials have been removed to the Oversize Materials Series. A
            Listing may be found at the end of this container list.]</p>

          <p>The series includes files on over 90 outdoor advertising companies. Most of the files
            are fairly brief and consist of only a promotional pamphlet, a news clipping or a TAB
            plant audit; other files are more extensive. Major firms, such as Columbus Outdoor,
            Thomas Cusack Co., John Donnelly &amp; Sons, Foster &amp; Kleiser, General Outdoor, and
            United Advertising are more heavily represented. The series also gives an overview into
            the scale of the outdoor industry in the U.S. during the second half of the 20th
            century.</p>
          <p>See also the Traffic Audit Bureau Series for other TAB materials.</p>
          <p>Arranged alphabetically by company name. Letter size folders are followed by legal size
            folders in two runs, and by oversize folders.</p>
          <p>[NOTE: Some large materials have been removed to the Oversize Materials Series. A
            Listing may be found at the end of this container list.]</p>

            been organized according to the company that produced the image. Where missing items are
            noted, those images have been removed due to preservation issues, and may not be

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>The main categories in this series are federal and state legislation, federal and state
            litigation, interest groups, and research relating to billboard regulation. The bulk of
            the material collected here concerns the legislation surrounding the creation of the
            Federal Interstate Highway System, notably the Federal Highway acts and Highway
            Beautification acts of the 1950s-1970s. There are files on various interest groups, such
            as the American Automobile Association and the General Federation of Women's Clubs, as
            well as the outdoor industry's own efforts to propose model billboard laws and plans for
            self-regulation.</p>
          <p>Overall, the series is arranged alphabetically by topic. Some sub-series are arranged
            chronologically; those are noted within the finding aid as appropriate. Letter size
            folders are followed by legal size folders in two runs.</p>
          <p>[NOTE: Some large materials have been removed to the Oversize Materials Series. A
            Listing may be found at the end of this container list.]</p>

          <p>The series includes files on the many state associations affiliated with the OAAA.
            Early in the 20th century, the OAAA instituted an umbrella organizational structure,
            whereby individual firms would be represented by state associations, which would in turn
            be linked nationally. Included here are the constitutions and by-laws of the state
            associations, along with correspondence and publications. Items also display the policy
            links between the national association and its state counterparts.</p>
          <p>Arranged alphabetically by state. Letter size folders are followed by legal size
            folders in two runs.</p>

          <p>The series includes files on the various trade organizations that served the outdoor
            industry at different times. Chief among them are the Institute of Outdoor Advertising
            (IOA), National Outdoor Advertising Bureau (NOAB), and Outdoor Advertising, Inc. (OAI,
            predecessor to the IOA). Researchers interested in those particular organizations will
            find extensive files; documentation of others is briefer. Information on other trade
            organizations may also be found in the Regulation, Research, and Physical Structure
            Series.</p>
          <p>Arranged alphabetically by association name. Letter size folders are followed by legal
            size folders in two runs.</p>
          <p>[NOTE: Some large materials have been removed to the Oversize Materials Series. A
            listing may be found at the end of this container list.]</p>
