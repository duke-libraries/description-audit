        teaching, and subject files documenting the career of Don Patinkin at the University of
        Chicago, the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and many other institutions. Extensive
        correspondence files include the names of many notable economists. Much of Patinkin's work
        relates to the career and theories of John Maynard Keynes; other areas of study include
        theories of money and value; interest; banking; macroeconomics; equilibrium theories; and
        unemployment. Many files contain information on Patinkin's considerable published output.
        Other files document his activities on behalf of many organizations such as the Bank of
        Israel, the Econometric Society, and the Maurice Falk Institute for Economic Research in
        Israel. Includes Patinkin's own early student notebooks while studying at the University of
        Chicago in the 1940's. There are a few photographs of Patinkin. Some materials are in
        Hebrew, and include documents relating to Patinkin's involvement in Israeli politics and
        economic development, as well as course materials from classes taught by Patinkin at Hebrew
        University.</abstract>

      <p>Within each subseries an attempt was made to organize the papers by date. This proved
        difficult because papers from several years may be gathered in a single file folder, and the
        effort to organize the papers stopped short of rearranging materials within and between file
        folders. One solution is to organize the papers by date of the book or journal article to
        which they were intended to contribute, and this was tried particularly in the University of
        Chicago School of Economics Series and Keynes and the History of Monetary Theory Series.
        This solution presents yet another problem, however: many of the papers represent research
        out of which sprung many articles over a long period of time. For this reason, the third
        (chronological) level of organization is less reliable.</p>
      <p>Folder titles in the container list below are chiefly taken from Patinkin's original folder
        titles. Dates have been given whenever possible. Undated materials are labeled "undated"</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The bulk of the professional papers of Don Patinkin date from the years he spent as an
        undergraduate and graduate student at the University of Chicago, beginning in 1942 and
        spanning his entire career, ending with his death in August, 1995. These are the dates of
        Patinkin's production or acquisition of the papers in the collection, but many of the
        documents in the collection are research materials that were produced earlier by others;
        these date chiefly from the 1930s. Materials represented include correspondence, book
        manuscripts and other manuscript drafts; course materials, including lectures, seminar
        notes, syllabi, student papers, and exams; student notebooks; committee and other
        organizational files; printed materials such as articles; book contracts; academic files,
        including recommendations and reports; some financial and legal files; invitations;
        clippings; and a few photographs. </p>
      <p>The main subjects of interest are related chiefly to Keynesian economics, but also to the
        neoclassical theory of value, equilibrium economics, theories of unemployment, and general
        monetary economics. Other subjects include the teaching of economics; the histories of
        Chicago University's School of Economics and Hebrew University in Jerusalem; the Israeli
        economy; Israeli agriculture; and social conditions in Israel and adjacent areas. Many of
        these subjects are discussed in Patinkin's major publications, whose drafts can also be
        found in the collection: these titles include <title type="simple" render="italic">Money,
          Interest, and Prices: An Integration of Monetary and Value Theory</title>; <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Keynes' Monetary Thought: A Study of Its
        Development</title>; <title type="simple" render="italic">Anticipations of the General
          Theory and Other Essays on Keynes</title>; <title type="simple" render="italic"> Essays on
          and in the Chicago Tradition</title>; and <title type="simple" render="italic">The Israel
          Economy: The First Decade.</title>
      </p>
      <p>Correspondents and chief protagonists during Patinkin's long career represent almost every
        major economist of the twentieth century, but the most prominent include Kenneth Arrow,
        Milton Friedman, Roy Harrod, John Hicks, Frank Knight, Harry Johnson, Simon Kuznets, Franco
        Modigliani, Dennis Robertson, Paul Samuelson, James Tobin, and Jacob Viner; Duke University
        faculty are represented by Craufurd Goodwin, Neil DeMarchi, and Roy Weintraub.</p>
      <p>The papers are currently organized in series corresponding, for the most part, to the
        different yet interrelated strains of literature to which Patinkin contributed over his
        life. The series are: University of Chicago School of Economics, General Monetary Theory,
        Keynes and the History of Monetary Theory, Correspondence, Israel and Hebrew Materials, and
        Miscellaneous. (Of course, in many cases Patinkin's work crosses the boundaries within this
        taxonomy.)</p>
      <p>Within each of the first three series the papers are further organized in subseries: Raw
        Materials, Course Materials, and Manuscripts and Notes. In general, the Raw Materials
        Subseries includes photocopied manuscripts of other economists, raw data, and other
        resources which Patinkin used in his research. (The term "raw materials" was the name he
        invented for such research materials.) The Course Materials Subseries includes syllabi,
        lecture notes, and photocopied readings which Patinkin used in his courses. The Manuscripts
        and Notes Subseries includes reprints and various stages of drafts of the many articles (and
        books) Patinkin wrote, and typewritten or handwritten notes he made in the course of his
        research.</p>
      <p>The largest series of the collection is the Correspondence Series, which consists of
        forty-two boxes of letters between Patinkin and his professional colleagues, as well as book
        publishers and conference organizers, from the 1930s through 1995. Patinkin was a prolific
        correspondent, and consequently this series is a rich mine of written exchanges between
        Patinkin and most of the outstanding figures in twentieth century economics. The letters in
        this series will be useful to researchers in a very broad domain of interests. They can be
        used to document the cross-currents of thought communicated between Patinkin and other
        economists, or they could be used in research which is in almost every respect unrelated to
        Patinkin. For example, one paper has already made use of the lengthy and somewhat
        contentious correspondence between Patinkin and a little-known mathematician as evidence of
        that man's views in quite another dispute with Kenneth Arrow and Nicolas Georgescu-Roegen
        over the role of mathematics in economic modelling. It should be noted that clippings,
        curriculum vitae and other personal data, and photographs can also be found in this
        series.</p>
      <p>The General Monetary Series contains materials related to the "neoclassical synthesis," the
        integration of Keynesian macroeconomics and the neoclassical theory of value pioneered by W.
        S. Jevons, Carl Menger, and Leon Walras, and developed by Alfred Marshall and A. C. Pigou.
        Patinkin is most widely known among economists for his contributions to this field. The
        first major work in the neoclassical synthesis was John Hicks's "Mr. Keynes and the
        Classics" (<title type="simple" render="italic">Econometrica,</title> 1937), which framed
        Keynes's General Theory as a static system of equations and represented involuntary
        unemployment as a solution to the system such that the labor market does not clear.
        Patinkin's contribution to the neoclassical synthesis began in 1947 with his University of
        Chicago PhD thesis <title type="simple" render="doublequote">On the Consistency of Economic
          Models: A Theory of Involuntary Unemployment,</title> and reached its pinnacle with his
        1956 book, <title type="simple" render="italic">Money, Interest, and Prices</title> (<title
          type="simple" render="italic">MIP</title>). (The book's subtitle, <title type="simple"
          render="italic">An Integration of Monetary and Value Theory,</title> is more descriptive
        of its contents).</p>
      <p>A second edition of <title type="simple" render="italic">MIP</title> was published in 1965,
        and an abridged version of the second edition, with a lengthy new introduction, was
        published in 1989. Materials related to the contents of <title type="simple" render="italic"
          >MIP</title> are found in the General Monetary Theory Series. They consist of -- among
        many other items -- drafts of both editions of the <title type="simple" render="italic"
          >MIP</title> (in Manuscripts and Notes), coursepacks from Patinkin's Monetary Economics
        Seminar at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and elsewhere (in Course Materials), and a
        large number of photocopied articles, representing major innovations in monetary and
        macro-economics from the mid-1960s through the late '80s, which Patinkin used in writing his
        introduction to the abridged second edition of <title type="simple" render="italic"
          >MIP.</title>
      </p>
      <p>In <title type="simple" render="italic">MIP</title> Patinkin emphasized the Walrasian
        (general equilibrium) aspect of the neoclassical theory of value, and introduced real money
        balances as another one of the many goods from which consumers derive utility. The major
        results of this approach were a derivation of the "equation of exchange", MV=PT, from
        microfoundations; and the dismissal of Hicks's favored cause of involuntary unemployment in
        his static system: the "liquidity trap" which occurs when agents are unwilling to substitute
        bonds for money below a certain interest rate. With regard to the latter result, Patinkin
        was thought by some to be undermining the Keynesian revolution. Patinkin's own view, to the
        contrary, was that he was contributing to that revolution by making the argument of the
        source of involuntary unemployment more sophisticated. Having done away with Hicks's
        "liquidity trap" explanation of unemployment, Patinkin indeed could no longer find any
        satisfying explanation of unemployment within the solution to the static system of
        equations. Instead, Patinkin thought of unemployment as a phenomenon occurring during the
        economy's dynamic adjustment towards the equilibrium represented by the solution to the
        static system. In other words, Patinkin re-framed Hicks's model of Keynesian "equilibrium
        unemployment" as a model of "disequilibrium unemployment."</p>
      <p>Patinkin was careful to place his work in <title type="simple" render="italic">MIP</title>
        in the context of the debates in monetary and macro-economics which preceded it and helped
        motivate it; this required extensive research of the work of Walras, Keynes, and many other
        figures in the history of economics. In fact Hicks, who reviewed <title type="simple"
          render="italic">MIP</title> for the <title type="simple" render="italic">Economic
          Journal,</title> claimed Patinkin's "detailed examination of Walras is one of the most
        impressive parts of Patinkin's book." Patinkin's work in the history of economics went far
        beyond a few chapters in <title type="simple" render="italic">MIP,</title> though. In 1976
        the University of Chicago Press published his book <title type="simple" render="italic"
          >Keynes' Monetary Thought: A Study of Its Development.</title> A number of his journal
        articles on Keynes and possible precursors are collected in <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Anticipations of the General Theory? And Other Essays on Keynes</title>
        (Duke University Press, 1982). In addition, Patinkin was on the advisory board of <title
          type="simple" render="italic">History of Political Economy</title> and was a frequent
        contributor to, and referee for, that journal.</p>
      <p>These historical interests are the basis of the Keynes and the History of Monetary Theory
        Series. Among the Manuscripts and Notes Subseries can be found early drafts of <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Anticipations,</title> and the entries for "J. M. Keynes"
        and "Walras' Law" which he was solicited to write for the <title type="simple"
          render="italic">New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics.</title> Course Materials Subseries
        includes coursepacks for the History of Monetary Theory Seminar which Patinkin taught at the
        Hebrew University, and which he viewed as essential for students in understanding the
        Monetary Economics Seminar. Among the Raw Materials are photocopied lecture notes, from a
        few different sources, on courses offered by Keynes and others at Cambridge in the early
        1930's. Also, within the Correspondence Series can be found numerous referee's reports
        Patinkin addressed to Craufurd Goodwin, editor of <title type="simple" render="italic"
          >History of Political Economy.</title> His reports tend to be detailed and meticulous --
        and often quite sharp.</p>
      <p>Patinkin also found subjects closer to home which stimulated his historical interests, and
        materials related to these areas of interest can be found in the University of Chicago
        School of Economics Series. Among his lecturers -- and greatest influences -- when he was a
        student at Chicago were Frank Knight and Jacob Viner, and, to a lesser extent, Lloyd Mints
        and Henry C. Simons. Knight and Viner encouraged historical scholarly work very early in
        Patinkin's formation as an economist, and they were figures of such stature that it should
        not be surprising that Patinkin was later to turn his historical focus towards them and the
        early "Chicago School" which they, together with Mints and Simons, represented.</p>
      <p>In 1981 Duke University Press published a collection of Patinkin's essays entitled <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Essays On and In the Chicago Tradition.</title> As the title
        suggests, the book is a mix of articles representing a "Chicago approach" to economic
        questions (for example Patinkin's "Multiple-Plant Firms, Cartels, and Imperfect
        Competition," written while still a graduate student at Chicago and published in 1947), and
        articles about the Chicago approach and the men who embodied it (for example "Frank Knight
        as Teacher" (1973) and "The Chicago Tradition, the Quantity Theory, and Friedman"
        (1969).</p>
      <p>The research Patinkin conducted in writing these and other articles in the same vein is the
        basis of the University of Chicago School of Economics Series. Among the Raw Materials are
        drafts of Patinkin's dissertation, lists of other dissertations in monetary economics
        written at the University of Chicago in the 1930's and '40's (including the one written by
        Patinkin's friend, and now Professor Emeritus at Duke, Martin Bronfenbrenner), and numerous
        reprints of articles by Frank Knight. The Manuscripts and Notes Subseries includes a number
        of slides Patinkin used in presentations of his paper <title type="simple"
          render="doublequote">In Search of the 'Wheel of Wealth': On the Origins of Frank Knight's
          Circular-Flow Diagram</title> which was published in 1973 and later included in <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Essays On and In the Chicago Tradition.</title> The slides,
        which present graphically early conceptions by different economists of the "circular flow"
        diagram now common in undergraduate macroeconomics texts, include the amusing 1887 diagram
        by Fleeming Jenkin which looks like five stick-figures skipping rope. Finally, the Course
        Materials Subseries is comprised entirely of one box of notebooks Patinkin kept from his
        undergraduate and graduate courses at Chicago.</p>
      <p>Aside from Patinkin's interests in the history of economics, but consistent with his
        broader interest in macroeconomics, Patinkin followed the development of the Israeli economy
        and wrote occasionally on economic conditions in Israel; he was frequently called upon to
        serve on committees advising the Israeli government. This work is the basis of the Israel
        and Hebrew Materials Series. Most of the papers in this series are in Hebrew, though
        Patinkin provided English-language translations of most titles. Correspondence can also be
        found in this series. Other materials referring to his activities in Israel can be found in
        the Correspondence Series in his communications with other colleagues and friends. </p>
      <p>His work in this area was no doubt motivated by the same attachment to Zionism and Israel
        that led him to begin seeking an academic position at the Hebrew University only a few
        months after he completed his preliminary exams for the Ph.D. at Chicago, and which was also
        represented by his first published article: "Mercantilism and the Readmission of the Jews to
        England" (<title type="simple" render="italic">Jewish Social Studies</title> 8, 1946:
        161-78). Patinkin's first idea for a Ph.D. thesis, in fact, was <title type="simple"
          render="doublequote">The International Economic Position of Palestine.</title> Although he
        abandoned the project due to lack of data, he continued to think along those lines --
        particularly after finally accepting a position at the Hebrew University and arriving in
        Jerusalem in 1949. In 1959 the Maurice Falk Institute for Economic Research in Israel
        published his book <title type="simple" render="italic">The Israel Economy: The First
          Decade</title>; and although he published no books on the topic afterward, he continued to
        write about it throughout his life.</p>

          <p>Contains scattered files of biographical data in addition to professional
            correspondence, which includes recommendations, permissions, and purchases. There are
            also some folders of clippings, book orders, and some photographs. This series reflects
            the complex and sometimes chronologically overlapping filing structures that Patinkin
            himself established. As much as possible, these filing systems were left intact, but to
            avoid excessive overlap some chronological re-organization was necessary. With a few
            exceptions, the arrangement within filing groups is alphabetical. File folders
            representing one person's or one institution's correspondence with Patinkin may appear
            in several physical locations depending on the chronological periods involved. There is
            one indexed subseries in which Patinkin used codes representing dates; this has been
            left untouched.</p>

          <p>Though almost all the materials are in Hebrew, many folders were marked by Patinkin
            with English titles. There are materials filed here whose subjects are related to other
            series above: for instance, Patinkin's Hebrew University course materials on general
            monetary theory are be found here rather than in the General Monetary Series. There are
            also numerous folders of correspondence in this series. Materials are not in date
