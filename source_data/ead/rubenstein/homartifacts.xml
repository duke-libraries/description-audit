      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The History of Medicine Collections artifacts collections began in 1956 with the donation
        of the Josiah C. Trent Collection, which formed the nucleus of the History of Medicine
        Collections at Duke Unversity's Medical Library. The Trent family's donation included many
        artifacts related to the practice of medicine. Subsequent acquisitions over the years from
        many other donors make up the rest of this collection, which forms part of the History of
        Medicine Collections at Duke University. The collection continues to receive additions.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection of historical medical instruments and artifacts, art objects, realia, and other
        three-dimensional objects, primarily originating from Europe and the United States, but
        including some artifacts from China and Japan. Ranging in age from the late 16th to the late
        20th centuries, objects include physician's medical kits and pharmaceutical items (often in
        the original cases and bags); clinical equipment used in amputation, obstetrics,
        opthalmology, surgery, neurology, early electrical therapies, and in research and diagnostic
        settings; instructional objects such as anatomical models; and art objects such as
        apothecary jars, a bas-relief memento mori, a marble skull, and fetish figures. There are
        many models of microscopes, from a small monocular "flea glass" to mid-20th century models.
        Other early medical instruments and supplies include amputation saws, bleeding bowls,
        cupping glasses, hypodermic needles, infant and invalid feeders, lancets, opthalmoscopes,
        pill rollers, stethoscopes, syringes, and other items. A more unusual item - and one of the
        larger pieces - is an adult walker made of wood, dating perhaps to the 19th century or
        earlier.</p>
      <p>There is also a large collection of early anatomical and diagnostic human models from China
        and continental Europe, in the shape of small, intricately detailed manikins. Most are made
        from ivory. Some feature removable anatomical parts, and female figures often include a
        removable fetus. There is also a model illustrating acupuncture points. Other instructional
        artifacts include glass slides used in medical school lectures.</p>
      <p>Most of these objects were photographed by library staff; at a later time, digital images
        of almost all of the objects in the collection were added to the online Duke University
        Historical Images in Medicine database, linked in this collection guide. Many of the
        original black-and-white photographic prints are filed in the History of Medicine Picture
        File collection. See the Related Materials section in this collection guide for links to
        these resources.</p>

            <p>Zeiss compound monocular microscope with mechanical stage. Signed: Carl Zeiss, Jena,
              No. 41871. Brass and black laquer on a cast-iron base. This microscope has the jug
              handle design which was introduced in 1898. Basically a hand grip was added to the
              limb of the microscope; at its best, the handle was integrated and sleek. The style
              did not last long and ended before 1920. White lettering on the cast-iron horseshoe
              base indicates the microscope once belonged to Dr. Frederic Moir Hanes, chair of the
              Department of Medicine.</p>
            <p> Dr. Carl Zeiss founded a business in Jena, Germany and began making microscopes in
              1847. His was the dominant optical firm in the world from the beginning of the 20th
              century through 1945 when it was seperated into two firms following partition of
              Germany after World War II. Many firms have been associated with the Zeiss firm and
              have produced Zeiss products under license or as partners. Bausch &amp; Lomb, which
              originated in Rochester, NY in 1853, was among those.</p>

            <p>Compound monocular. Unsigned. Brass with wooden carrying case. The microscope
              attaches to a brass fitting on the top of the case which then acts as a base.
              Accessories included are brass opticals, a bull's-eye condenser, and ivory specimen
              slides.</p>
            <p> In the 18th century there was a demand for microscopes which could be kept in a
              small space and carried into the field. The "pack-away" microscope reached its heyday
              between 1790 and 1830. Such instruments were made for the amateur market since no
              serious microscopist would want to keep dismantling his instrument. The Cary-type
              microscope came in a limited variety of sizes. This is one of the larger versions.</p>

            <p>Marked V. Mueller &amp; Co., USA. Includes handle with eight interchangeable
              cups.</p>
            <p> Used for removal of cataractous lens until the 1960s. Invented in 1917 by Ignacio
              Barraquer and improved in 1948 by A. E. Bell. The little cup was applied to the
              surface of the lens, suction was applied, then the cup with the adherent lens pulled
              out of the eye through a large corneal opening.</p>

            <p>Includes a drawer and accessories. [Horne, Thornthwaite and Wood, London?] This
              all-brass instrument with a claw-footed base is mounted on a wooden stand which was
              made to slide into its case. Before storage the body-tube would have to have been
              detached. One of the accessories is a bull's eye condenser lens attached to an
              adjustable arm which was intended to be inserted through a pillar, allowing it to
              stand independently of the microscope.</p>
            <p> The original version of this educational microscope was made in 1854 by G. Field of
              Birmingham.</p>

            <p> Unknown material, possibly silica glass. One common way in which lechatelierite
              forms naturally is by very high temperature melting of quartz sand during a lightning
              strike. Lechatelierite may also form artificially, a unique example being the
              trinitite produced by melting of quartz sand at the first nuclear bomb explosion at
              Trinity Flats, White Sands, New Mexico.</p>

            <p>Compound binocular, signed: M. Pillischer, London, No. 1441. This brass microscope
              has four high-quality objective lenses and two sets of eyepieces housed in the
              original wooden case with brass handle.</p>
            <p> A great advance in optics was achieved in the mid 19th century with the development
              of achromatic lenses. These employed a combination of lens elements, constructed from
              two or more different types of glass, to correct the spherical and chromatic
              aberations that had limited the image quality and resolution of lenses for the
              previous two hundred years. The optical binocular vision is different from that in
              modern microscopes. It reduces resolution slightly but gives a stereoscopic image.</p>

            <p> Dr. Carl Zeiss founded a business in Jena, Germany and began making microscopes in
              1847. His was the dominant optical firm in the world from the beginning of the 20th
              century through 1945 when it was separated into two firms following partition of
              Germany after World War II. Many firms have been associated with the Zeiss firm and
              have produced Zeiss products under license or as partners. Bausch &amp; Lomb, which
              originated in Rochester, N.Y. in 1853, was among those.</p>

            <p>Simple monocular microscope, signed E. Culpepper, Londini. Brass with ivory handle.
              Housed in a small box covered in fish-skin and lined with green velvet. Some of the
              original parts are missing (notably the extension for opaque objects); however, it
              does include: six brass-mounted objectives, four ivory sliders, one brass slider, or
              animalcule cage, for living specimens, one opaque specimen holder with black and white
              disks and forceps, and one small ivory talc box.</p>
            <p> Developed by 1710, the brass screw-barrel microscope was the most common pocket
              microscope produced by instument makers in the 18th century. Intended primarily for
              tranparent specimens, this single lens microscope's small size, ease of use, and low
              price made it quite popular among amateurs. Normally held by an ivory handle screwed
              to the side of the body, the microscope could also be mounted via a ball joint at the
              top of a pillar which stood on a flat tripod. Over time many modifications were made
              to the original design and numerous accessories were employed which allowed a broader
              range of use.</p>

            <p>Nkisi Nkondi. African healing statue. BaKongo, Congo - between 1880 and 1910. Wood,
              pigment, metal and glass.</p>
            <p> Minkisi (singular nkisi) are ritual objects used by the BaKongo (people of the
              Congo) for oath taking and healing. They are complex objects that derive their power
              from the dead, and to them, paradoxically, have been attributed the abilities both to
              afflict and to heal, to visit good as well as evil on a person.</p>

            <p>Compound monocular microscope, unsigned. Made of brass with cutaway on both
              sides.</p>
            <p> Popular in England between 1820 and 1850, the drum microscope evolved from a design
              introduced in 1738 by London optician Benjamin Martin, author of the "Pocket
              Reflecting Microscope." The name came from the drum-shaped section below the stage.
              Focusing was achieved by manipulating the telescopic body tube. This portable pocket
              microscope was typically made of thin brass with a round base and cut-out side. Some
              versions were sold in toy shops.</p>

            <p>Compound binocular. Signed: Spencer, Buffalo, USA. This example has a pair of metal
              hand rests.</p>
            <p> One of the first American microscopes was made in 1850 by C.A. and H.R. Spencer of
              Canastota, New York. Spencer lenses earned a reputation at home and abroad and some
              experts considered them superior to any European product. Spencer objectives received
              a Gold Medal at the 1878 Paris Exhibition. The firm subsequently moved to Buffalo in
              1890. The complex business history of the firm involved multiple names and leadership
              changes. In 1935 the Spencer Lens Company was absorbed by the American Optical
              Company.</p>

            <p>Made of ivory. Essentially a simple magnifier with only one power (7x). Usually the

              pin on which to place the specimen and a base with glass discs to serve as "slides"

            <p>A caustic pencil is a short stick of medication usually containing silver nitrate,
              used to cauterize skin, for instance for the treatment of nosebleeds, removal of
              warts, or pyogenic granuloma. They are not used as a treatment for minor cuts. A
              frequent source of confusion appears to be the difference between styptic and caustic
              pencils. Silver nitrate sticks are often used for hemostasis in medical situations
              where patients are not under general anesthesia, where electrocautery would be painful
              and inconvenient.</p>
