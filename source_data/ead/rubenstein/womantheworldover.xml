      <abstract id="aspace_25b79a4781bd4d8ea67b9a7ab6f111e9">Collection consists of a commercially
        produced set of 48 hand-colored glass lantern slides entitled "Woman: The World Over,"
        published in 1901 by Riley Brothers in Bradford, England. The original printed booklet
        accompanying the set lists 53 slides in all, and contains detailed lecture-format captions.
        The women in the portraits represent nations around the world. Subjects include women of
        different classes; married women and women in courtship; there are women depicted in their
        homes, with children, and in roles which the lecture suggests are little more than slaves.
        Other slides show women working in agricultural, service, and industrial settings, and
        gambling and climbing mountains. There is one slide of the Women's Temple in Chigago,
        headquarters of the Women's Christian Temperance Union. Lecture notes refer to problematic
        social conditions for women, particularly regarding marriage, and changing social norms as
        the 20th century begins. One slide is black-and-white. All titles are original, as is the
        slide sequence. Acquired as part of the Lisa Unger Baskin Collection at Duke
        University.</abstract>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>Collection consists of a nearly complete lecture set of 48 hand-colored glass lantern
        slides published in England. The original printed booklet accompanying the set bears the
        full title, "Woman: the world over. A lecture to accompany a series of 54 photographic
        transparencies for the optical lantern." The price appearing on the booklet is sixpence. </p>
      <p>The booklet lists 53 slides in this set, and contains detailed lecture-format captions
        which would be read aloud as the slides were projected. The series is incomplete: numbers
        28, 47, 48, 51, 53, and 54 are not present. Titles are also printed along the mount edges of
        each slide but are obscured in a few cases by black repair tape. All titles are original, as
        is the slide order. The titles and lecture script contain historical terms and language that
        may be offensive to modern-day audiences. The slides measure 3 1/4 inches square (83 x 83
        mm).</p>
      <p>The slides and lecture notes were originally arranged in six series, retained in this
        description: Woman in Society; The Domestic Woman; Woman in Subjection; Emancipated Woman;
        Woman the Breadwinner; and Angelic Woman. </p>
      <p>The women in the portraits represent races, cultures and nations around the world, among
        which British Guiana, China, Iceland, India, Japan, Netherlands, the Philippines, Russia,
        Switzerland, Tonga, Tunisia, and the U.S. There are portraits of women with high social
        status, married women, and women in courtship; there are women depicted in their homes,
        women with children, and in roles of subjugation which the lecture suggests are little more
        than slaves. A few images include men. </p>
      <p>The series "Woman the Breadwinner" includes agricultural, craft, and industrial scenes, and
        a slide of women nurses attending to patients. The "Emancipated Woman" series includes an
        actress, a group of nurses, and women mountaineering. There is one slide of the Women's
        Temple in Chigago, headquarters for the Women's Christian Temperance Union from 1892 to
        1926. Titles are present on the edges of most of the glass slide mounts, and are listed in
        full in the booklet.</p>
      <p>The booklet's lecture notes refer to problematic social conditions for women, particularly
        regarding marriage, as well as changing social norms as the 20th century begins. The series
        ends with romantic images of ideal women, chiefly through the lens of courtship and beauty.
        Most of the missing slides are from this group.</p>
      <p>The set held by the Rubenstein is numbered 1239 in the lecture booklet. There is no date on
        either the slides or the booklet, but the Women's Temple in Chigago, completed in 1892,
        provides the earliest date. A slide entitled "Wife of the Khedive" helps provide the latest
        date: the Egyptian title "Khedive" was last used in 1914. The Lucerna Magic Lantern Web
        Resource (viewed online November 8 2017) gives the publisher as the Riley Brothers of
        Bradford, Yorkshire, England, and the publication date as 1901.</p>

        Unger Baskin Collection at Duke University.</p>

            <p>The adjective "Kaffir" was widely used in 19th and 20th century South Africa as a
              pejorative term for black Africans, particularly Bantu people. The term was also used
              for a Sri Lankan population brought to the island by the Portuguese in the 16th
              century. In this case the term was and still is used as a non-derogatory,
              self-identifying ethnic term.</p>

            <p>The adjective "Kaffir" was widely used in 19th and 20th century South Africa as a
              pejorative term for black Africans, particularly Bantu people. The term was also used
              for a Sri Lankan population brought to the island by the Portuguese in the 16th
              century. In this case the term was and still is used as a non-derogatory,
              self-identifying ethnic term.</p>
