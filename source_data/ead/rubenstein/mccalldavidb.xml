         <abstract id="aspace_4ae80eed65cfc435786d2df3e577e364">David B. McCall was an advertising
            executive and humanitarian. He was the originator of the idea for the children's
            educational television series Schoolhouse Rock. The David B. McCall Papers span the
            years 1939-1999, with the bulk documenting the years 1980-1994, and are comprised of
            clippings, correspondence, business reports, photographs, scrapbooks, speeches and
            writings, videocassettes, audio tapes and phonograph records. In particular, three main
            areas of McCall's career are represented: as an advertising executive and partner in
            agencies such as Young &amp; Rubicam, Ogilvy Benson &amp; Mather, McCaffrey &amp;
            McCall, David J. Mahoney, Inc., the Sawyer Miller Group, and Shepardson Stern and
            Kaminsky; as a corporate director for the Hunter Fan Company, Save the Children, and two
            local radio broadcasting corporations, among others; and as a humanitarian involved with
            organizations such as the Committee for the Support of Roe v. Wade, CARE, and Refugees
            International. In addition, there is a substantial body of McCall's speeches and
            writings that reflect both the wide range of his professional and personal interests and
            commitments as well as his status as a public intellectual in high demand, as well as a
            number of files containing correspondence, clippings and articles concerning David
            Ogilvy, McCall's mentor in advertising. Major advertising campaigns represented in this
            collection include Mercedes Benz of North America, North American Philips, Life
            magazine, the American Can Company, Lever Brothers Company, and the Zippo Manufacturing
            Company, along with public relations work for such clients as the National Football
            League, Puerto Rico Telephone Company (PRTC), and the Regional Bell Operating Companies.
            Major humanitarian issues documented in the collection include the Unsell protest
            movement against the war in Vietnam, tobacco advertising aimed at children, land mine
            removal, refugee welfare, and support of abortion rights. McCall was also involved in
            political campaigns for a number of notable candidates, such as John Lindsay (New York),
            Harvey Gannt (North Carolina), George Kevarian (Massachusetts), Ramón Mitra
            (Philippines) and Mario Vargas Llosa (Peru). While McCall is recognized as the
            originator of the idea behind the popular children's educational television series
            Schoolhouse Rock!, the collection contains very little documentation concerning that
            project apart from a copy of the original soundtrack.</abstract>

            professional and personal interests and commitments as well as his status as a public
            intellectual in high demand, as well as a number of files containing correspondence,
            clippings and articles concerning David Ogilvy, McCall's mentor in advertising. Major
            advertising campaigns represented in this collection include Mercedes Benz of North
            America, North American Philips, <title type="simple" render="italic">Life</title>
            magazine, the American Can Company, Lever Brothers Company, and the Zippo Manufacturing
            Company, along with public relations work for such clients as the National Football
            League, Puerto Rico Telephone Company (PRTC), and the Regional Bell Operating Companies.
            Major humanitarian issues documented in the collection include the <emph
               render="doublequote">Unsell</emph> protest movement against the war in Vietnam,
            tobacco advertising aimed at children, land mine removal, refugee welfare, and support
            of abortion rights. McCall was also involved in political campaigns for a number of
            notable candidates, such as John Lindsay (New York), Harvey Gannt (North Carolina),
            George Kevarian (Massachusetts), Ramón Mitra (Philippines) and Mario Vargas Llosa
            (Peru). While McCall is recognized as the originator of the idea behind the popular
            children's educational television series <title type="simple" render="italic"
               >Schoolhouse Rock!</title>, the collection contains very little documentation
            concerning that project apart from a copy of the original soundtrack.</p>
         <p>The collection is organized into 12 series that broadly outline the sequence of McCall's
            business and humanitarian activities: the <emph render="bold">Biographical and Personal
               Materials Series,</emph> the <emph render="bold">Ogilvy &amp; Mather Series</emph>,
            the <emph render="bold">McCaffrey &amp; McCall Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold"
               >Radio Stations Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Sawyer Miller Group
               Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Hunter Fan Company Series</emph>, the <emph
               render="bold">Shepardson, Stern &amp; Kaminsky Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold"
               >Refugees International Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Speeches
            Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph>, and the <emph
               render="bold">Portfolio Series</emph>. In addition, non-print materials have been
            removed to the <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials Series</emph>. Large-format
            print materials have been removed from their original series locations and relocated to
               <emph render="bold">Oversize Materials</emph> locations; these items have been
            cross-referenced to the points in the body of the collection from which they were
            removed. </p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Biographical and Personal Materials Series</emph> contains
            materials relating to McCall's childhood and family life, and includes correspondence,
            photographs, biographical sketches, resumes and obituary notices. The <emph
               render="bold">Ogilvy &amp; Mather Series</emph> includes correspondence and articles
            pertaining to the agency, along with profiles and tributes to agency founder David
            Ogilvy and correspondence between Ogilvy and McCall. The <emph render="bold">McCaffrey
               &amp; McCall Series</emph> includes correspondence, corporate publications and client
            files. Legal documents that detail McCall's initial investment and employment in the
            C.J. Laroche &amp; Co. agency, which was eventually renamed McCaffrey &amp; McCall, are
            included. Major clients include Mercedes-Benz of North America, the New York Zoological
            Society, and Save the Children. The agency was also involved in the political campaign
            of New York Mayor John Lindsay. The <emph render="bold">Radio Stations Series</emph>
            includes correspondence, periodic reports and profit-and-loss statements for the 790
            Communications Corporation and the 1340 Broadcasting Corporation, radio broadcasting
            corporations in which McCaffrey &amp; McCall had invested, and in which McCall remained
            involved after retiring from the agency. The <emph render="bold">Sawyer Miller Group
               Series</emph> contains administrative records, correspondence and client files.
            Sawyer Miller was instrumental in helping the telecommunications industry after the
            breakup of the Bell system into regional operating companies. Other clients included the
            National Football League and the Puerto Rico Telephone Company, along with a number of
            political candidates. </p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Hunter Fan Company Series</emph> consists primarily of reports
            pertaining to periodic meetings of the Board of Directors in addition to some
            information on marketing strategies and advertising campaigns. The <emph render="bold"
               >Shepardson, Stern &amp; Kaminsky Series</emph> contains administrative files and
            correspondence relating to internal operations and political advertising, as well as
            files documenting McCall's advocacy work on a tobacco-free initiative aimed at children.
            The <emph render="bold">Refugees International Series</emph> documents McCall's
            involvement in a number of humanitarian efforts undertaken by Refugees International,
            including relief for refugee children and land mine eradication. The series includes
            correspondence, travel itineraries and trip journals kept by McCall, as well as printed
            materials from Refugees International and other humanitarian organizations. The <emph
               render="bold">Speeches Series</emph> includes texts of speeches, talks, and
            commencement addresses given by McCall, along with a small collection of speeches given
            by others. There is also a set of <emph render="doublequote">speech files</emph> that
            contain clippings, writing fragments, and other materials used to compose or plan
            speeches. In a few cases, speeches are accompanied by supporting materials and relevant
            correspondence. The <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph> includes letters to the
            editors of various publications, journal articles, poetry and other writings by McCall,
            along with a small collection of writings by others. The <emph render="bold">Portfolio
               Series</emph> contains clippings, copies of advertisements and scrapbook contents
            relating primarily to McCall's early career. The <emph render="bold">Audiovisual
               Materials Series</emph> includes documentary and promotional films, commercials and
            radio spot announcements, especially concerning the Roe v. Wade court case and demining
            efforts supported by Refugees International. Oversize materials have been moved to the
               <emph render="bold">Oversize Materials Series</emph>.</p>

               <p>Contains administrative records, correspondence and client files. Sawyer Miller,
                  where McCall served as a partner from 1989 to 1993, was instrumental in helping
                  the telecommunications industry after the breakup of the Bell system into regional
                  operating companies. Other clients included the National Football League and the
                  Puerto Rico Telephone Company, along with a number of political candidates such as
                  Harvey Gannt of North Carolina and George Keverian of Massachusetts, and
                  international leaders including Ramón Mitra (presidential candidate, Philippines)
                  and Mario Vargas Llosa (presidential candidate, Peru). The series is organized
                  into three subseries--Administrative Files, Clients, and Correspondence and
                  Memoranda--and alphabetically therein.</p>

               <p>Includes texts of speeches, talks, and commencement addresses given by McCall,

                  fragments, and other materials used to compose or plan speeches. In a few cases,

                  series is arranged into two subseries--Speeches by McCall and Speeches by Others.
                  Speeches by McCall are organized into a number of topical categories--advertising,
                  commencement addresses, social-political issues, testimonials, and speech file
                  materials--and alphabetically therein. Speeches by Others are arranged

                  social-political--and alphabetically therein. Writings by Others are arranged
