         <abstract id="aspace_62655cdac440968ba8b9fd1b29d5cc7f">Official magazine of the Democratic
            National Committee, published monthly in Washington D.C. Its editors were Clayton
            Fritchey, Sam Brightman, and Philip M. Stern, with political cover art by Leo
            Hershfield. Collection contains editorial files of the Democratic Digest, dating from
            1953-1961, with the contents of the files falling into three large categories:
            correspondence, editorial, and art files. The correspondence includes many letters from
            readers, critics, and Democratic Senators and Governors, chiefly in response to
            political issues of the day such as McCarthyism, corruption, civil rights, economics,
            labor, nuclear weapons, farm subsidies, party politics, and elections. Editorial files
            contain edited copy for articles and columns; TV and radio scripts, including speeches
            by Democratic candidates; and many clippings reprinted in the Digest. About a third of
            the collection consists of hundreds of pieces of original layout art, including
            political cartoons by Leo Hershfield and others, and a few photographs of political
            leaders such as Truman, Stevenson, and Johnson. Finally, a smaller group of printed
            materials published for the Democratic 1960 national campaign includes political
            leaflets, pamphlets, party platforms and position papers, a newsprint publication
            examining of the records of Nixon and Kennedy, and a few other items.</abstract>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The <title type="simple" render="italic">Democratic Digest</title> was the small-format
            magazine of the Democratic National Committee, with its offices based in Washington,
            D.C. The monthly issues chiefly consisted of editorial columns, election news, political
            cartoons and satire, and many reprinted articles and opinion pieces from pro-Democratic
            U.S. newspapers. Its predecessor, also titled the <title type="simple" render="italic"
               >Democratic Digest</title>, was published by the Women's Division of the Democratic
            National Committee from 1933-1953. The <title type="simple" render="italic">Democratic
               Digest</title> was continued in 1961 as <title type="simple" render="italic">The
               Democrat</title>.</p>
         <p>The chief editor during the time represented by this collection was Clayton Fritchey
            (1904-2001), a journalist who was also assistant to the Secretary of Defense and
            assistant to President Trumann; he also had close relations with Adlai Stevenson in
            various capacities. The managing editor was Samuel C. Brightman (1911-1992), noted
            Washington correspondent and Democratic Party public relations manager. Serving as
            senior editor was Philip Stern (1926-1992), also director of research for the Democratic
            National Committee (1953-1956); and deputy assistant to the Secretary of State for
            Public Affairs (1961-1962). The <title type="simple" render="italic">Democratic
               Digest</title>'s cover artist was Leo Hershfield, noted illustrator and courtroom
            artist; many pieces of his original artwork are in the Art and Layout Series.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Collection contains editorial files of the <title type="simple" render="italic"
               >Democratic Digest</title>, dating from 1953-1961, with the contents of the files
            falling into three large categories: correspondence, editorial, and art files. The
            correspondence files, arranged in alphabetical order, include telegrams and memoranda
            between the <title type="simple" render="italic">Democratic Digest</title> staff, the
            Democratic National Committee and other organizations, and many letters from readers,
            critics, and Democratic Senators and Governors, chiefly responding to political issues
            of the day, such as McCarthyism, scandals and corruption, civil rights, the American
            economy, labor, farm subsidies, nuclear weapons, war, and elections, and offering
            criticism on the content of the publication. There is also some personal
            correspondence.</p>
         <p>Voluminous editorial files contain nearly complete content for issues, and are filed in
            publication order by month and year, 1955-1961. The files enclose copy for articles and
            columns, with many corrections and layout notes; condensed versions of TV and radio
            addresses, including speeches by Democratic candidates; and many clippings from original
            articles reprinted in the <title type="simple" render="italic">Digest</title>, attached
            to the magazine's own copy. Some of this material is brittle and fragile.</p>
         <p>About a third of the collection consists of hundreds of pieces of original layout art,
            printers proofs of covers, and political cartoons, and a handful of photographs of
            Democratic leaders of the time such as Truman, Stevenson, and Johnson (Box 25). For an
            unknown reason, there is also a portrait of Durham native and Duke alumnus and
            benefactor William Washington Flowers. A few complete copies of the <title type="simple"
               render="italic">Digest</title> are sometimes included in the artwork files next to
            associated cover art. There are many examples of production artists' layout materials
            that include original art and sketches, and paste-ups on boards with directions for
            layout. The original art for the cover cartoons by noted illustrator Leo Hershfield is
            rendered in vivid watercolors. The artwork and layouts are loosely arranged in
            chronological order.</p>
         <p>Finally, a smaller group of printed materials deriving from the Democratic 1960 national
            campaign includes political leaflets, pamphlets, party platforms and position papers, a
            newsprint publication examining of the records of Nixon and Kennedy, and a few other
            items.</p>
