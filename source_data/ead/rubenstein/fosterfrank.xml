         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Frank B. Foster, III was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on September 23, 1928. He attended
            Wilberforce University and in 1949 moved to Detroit and began playing in jazz clubs with
            musicians such as Wardell Gray. He was drafted into the military in 1951 and served in
            Korea.</p>
         <p>In the early 1950s his first two solo albums were released on Blue Note Records: <title
               type="simple" render="doublequote">Here Comes Frank Foster</title> (1953) and <title
               type="simple" render="doublequote">New Faces, New Sounds</title> (1954). He was a
            member of the Count Basie Orchestra from 1953-1964, contributing both arrangements and
            original compositions including the well-known <title type="simple" render="doublequote"
               >Shiny Stockings, </title>
            <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Down for the Count, </title>
            <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Blues Backstage, </title>
            <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Back to the Apple, </title> and <title
               type="simple" render="doublequote">Discommotion, </title> as well as arrangements for
            the band's <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Easin' It</title> album. Foster has
            also performed in bands including The Lloyd Price Big Band, Lionel Hampton and his
            Orchestra, Woody Herman and his Orchestra, The Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra, and Elvin
            Jones's Jazz Machine. By the 1970s Foster formed several groups on his own, including
            The Non-Electric Company, Living Color and The Loud Minority. In 1980, Foster's <title
               type="simple" render="doublequote">Lake Placid Suite</title> was performed as a part
            of the Winter Olympic Games, and in 1983 Dizzy Gillespie personally commissioned Foster
            to orchestrate one of the jazz icon's compositions, <title type="simple"
               render="doublequote">Con Alma, </title> for a scheduled performance and recording
            with The London Philharmonic Orchestra directed by Robert Farnon. In 1986 Foster
            succeeded Thad Jones as the leader of the Count Basie Orchestra, and remained with the
            band until 1995. During that time he won two Grammy Awards for his arrangements of
               <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Deedles' Blues</title> (1987) and <title
               type="simple" render="doublequote">Basie's Bag</title> (1988).</p>
         <p>Foster's career also included a strong interest in teaching. In 1971 he served as
            Artist-In-Residence for the New England Conservatory of Music. He also began teaching
            music for the N.Y. Public Schools in Harlem under the Title I program, <title
               type="simple" render="doublequote">Cultural Enrichment Through Music, Dance, and
               Song.</title> From 1972 to 1976, Foster was an Assistant Professor in the Black
            Studies Program at the State University of New York at Buffalo (SUNY). He has also
            worked as an adjunct professor at institutions including The New School for Social
            Research and New York University. In 1987, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by
            Central State (formerly Wilberforce) University.</p>
         <p>During his long musical career, Foster has been commissioned to compose and arrange
            works for The Carnegie Hall Jazz Ensemble, The Detroit Civic Symphony Orchestra, The
            Jazzmobile Corporation of New York City, The Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, The Thad
            Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra, The Harpers Ferry Historical Association, The Chicago Jazz
            Ensemble, and many others. In 2002 Foster received the Jazz Masters Award from the
            National Endowment for the Arts.</p>
         <p>In 2001 he suffered a stroke that impaired his left side and caused him to cease
            performing on saxophone. He continues to compose and arrange for a variety of bands and
            leads a revival of The Loud Minority in limited engagements.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Frank Foster Papers span the dates 1930 to 2013, with the bulk of the materials
            dating from the 1950s to 2009. The papers consist chiefly of scores and parts composed
            or arranged by Foster for big bands and other large jazz ensembles, including works
            written for the Count Basie Orchestra in the 1950s-1960s and again in the 1980s-1990s,
            as well as works for The Loud Minority, and numerous other bands and organizations for
            which Foster was commissioned to compose. The collection is arranged in the following
            series: Compositions by Frank Foster, Compositions by Others, Personal Files, and Audio
            and Moving Image Materials. The compositions series are organized into Letter-Sized,
            Legal-Sized and Oversized subseries. The personal files consist of autobiographical
            writings, correspondence, photographs, business records, publicity, reviews, and news
            clippings; and subject files on musical collaborations, music teaching, organizations
            and individuals, and family history. Audio and moving image materials are primarily
            concert recordings featuring Foster from the 1970s through the 1990s. Acquired as part
            of the Jazz Archive at Duke University.</p>

               <p>Consists of manuscript scores and instrumental parts for works composed and
                  arranged by Frank Foster, arranged into three subseries: Letter-Sized Materials,
                  Legal-Sized Materials, and Oversized Materials. Within each subseries, manuscripts
                  are organized alphabetically by title, where different versions and copies of the
                  same composition are grouped together. Many manuscripts are undated. Collection
                  includes hand-written manuscripts, photocopies, and manuscripts produced on a
                  laser printer. Incomplete manuscripts, unidentified pages and fragments are filed
                  in a separate group at the end of the Compositions by Others series.</p>
               <p>Many scores and parts are unbound; please handle carefully and keep pages in their
                  original order. </p>

                  Miscellaneous Manuscripts, which includes manuscript fragments of compositions by
                  Foster, by others, and of unknown authorship. Within each subseries, manuscripts
                  are organized alphabetically by title, where different versions and copies of the
                  same composition are grouped together. Many manuscripts are undated. Collection
                  includes hand-written manuscripts, photocopies, and manuscripts produced on a
                  laser printer. Many are unbound; please handle carefully and keep pages in their
