        is an international human rights advocacy organization headquartered in Washington D.C. The
        Washington Office on Latin America Records span the dates 1962 to 2008 and consist of
        research and project files on nearly every country in Latin America, administrative records,
        clippings, correspondence, and printed material, all relating to the work of the Washington
        Office on Latin America (WOLA), a human rights advocacy organization based in Washington
        D.C. WOLA partners with local organizations in Latin America and the Caribbean to raise
        awareness of human rights abuses in the region and to influence the foreign policy agenda of
        the United States government. Materials in this collection provide a rich resource for the
        study of politically motivated violence and other human rights abuses throughout Latin
        America and also document the changing political climate towards the region in Washington
        D.C. over nearly four decades.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Washington Office on Latin America Records span the dates 1962 to 2008 and consist of
        research and project files on nearly every country in Latin America, administrative files,
        clippings, correspondence, and printed material, all related to the work of the Washington
        Office on Latin America (WOLA), a human rights advocacy organization based in Washington
        D.C. WOLA partners with local organizations in Latin America and the Caribbean to raise
        awareness of human rights abuses in the region and to influence the foreign policy agenda of
        the United States government. Materials in this collection provide a rich resource for the
        study of politically motivated violence and other human rights abuses throughout Latin
        America, and document the changing political attitudes towards the region on the part of the
        U.S. government over nearly four decades. Numerous files of individual human rights abuse
        cases, including torture, forced disappearances, and executions can be found in this
        collection. In addition, WOLA's efforts to lobby for legislative change are chronicled
        throughout the collection. Material includes some ephemeral or hard-to-find printed material
        produced by leftist or guerilla groups in Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, and Mexico, as well as
        some audiovisual recordings housed within country files.</p>
      <p>The collection is arranged in the following series: Administrative Files, Geographic,
        Initiatives and Activities, Sound Recordings, and Oversize Material. The Administrative
        Files Series contains records kept by WOLA directors and staff, many funding-related files,
        some overviews of WOLA's activities, and other files of an administrative nature such as
        meeting minutes and planning, and staff retreats. The largest in the collection, the
        Geographic Series is divided into subseries for most countries in the region, documenting
        the major political and human rights issues associated with each country. These files
        typically include large sub-groupings on the following broad topics: human rights cases
        specific to that country; economic development; drug policy and related issues, especially
        in Colombia and Mexico; elections; police and military; U.S. policy; international
        relations; files related to WOLA visits to or activities in that country; and in some cases,
        files of printed materials assembled by WOLA staff. The human rights files cover such issues
        as labor rights, peasants' rights and land reforms, indigenous people's rights, politically
        motivated abuses, killings, and discrimination, civil rights cases of all kinds,
        reconciliation and truth commissions, and the activities of human rights organizations in
        each country and in the U.S. The Initiatives and Activities Series, divided into topical
        categories as arranged by WOLA staff, covers the organization's issue-based work in areas
        such as U.S. drug policy, trade and banking, democratic and peace processes, economic
        development, issues related to the deployment of military and police forces, and more. A
        large group of records documents the extensive legislative work performed by WOLA on behalf
        of human rights issues. There is considerable overlap between this series and the Geographic
        Series. The Sound Recordings Series contains recordings of conferences, speeches, and events
        sponsored by WOLA and other groups. Finally, the six boxes in the Oversize Material section
        at the end of this collection guide contain large items such as posters and newspapers
        separated from the main collection and rehoused for preservation purposes. Materials are
        chiefly in English and Spanish, with a smaller percentage in French and Portuguese. All of
        the series and each subseries are described in more detail in the description of the
        collection that follows. Unprocessed additions to the collection have been added at the end
        of the finding aid. Collection was acquired as part of the Duke University's Archive for
        Human Rights.</p>

            <p>Documents pertaining to WOLA initiatives or projects to be funded. Includes targeted
              mailings; lists of contacts and prospects for funding; application materials and
              guidelines; grant proposals; newsletters and other publications regarding funding
              institutions; WOLA activity reports over a long time span; correspondence with funding
              institutions; and information on funding institutions regarding past grants.
              International donor files often contain copies of form letters relating to the
              Advocacy Training Project, while others contain larger amounts of materials such as
              reports, correspondence, follow-up material, and proposals. Other initiatives focus on
              violence against women (see the Liz Claiborne files, box 2), and drug policy work
              (Century Foundation Files, box 2). U.S. prospective donor files include information on
              Oxfam, Century Foundation, and the Greenville Foundation. Files retain arrangement and
              titles of folders as received from WOLA.</p>

                strategic planning notes, mission statements, and extensive descriptions of the
                functions of various working groups and their status at that time. A significant set
                of files documents a major WOLA planning retreat held in 2002, and discusses all
                aspects of its operations and programs. Also includes a large file of material on
                WOLA's efforts to gain consultative status with the United Nations. Other WOLA
                planning documents can be found scattered in other subseries in the Administrative
                Files, as well as other series in the collection, especially Initiatives and
                Activities. Tax returns and financial statements from 1979 through 2006 make up the
                bulk of the financial files.</p>

              <p>As with the Director's Files, a varied set of office files created in support of
                key positions at WOLA. Most files date from the 2000s. Includes such material as
                memos, organizational lists, files of contacts, outreach files, web development,
                planning for events, WOLA reprints, and a few news clippings files dating from about

          <p>Files on individual countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, containing material
            assembled and maintained by the staff of the Washington Office on Latin America.
            Countries represented are: <emph render="bold">Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,
              Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras,
              Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Perú, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela</emph>.
            The largest subseries are Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, Haiti, Mexico, and Perú. Most
            geographic files are a mix of documents created in each country and in the United
            States. Nearly all country subseries contain the following folder groups: Human Rights,
            U.S. Relations, and WOLA Files. Human Rights files document specific cases of abuse as
            well as some the organizations with which WOLA partners to improve the situation. U.S.
            Relations files, a major focus in each subseries, contain information on pending U.S.
            legislation, testimony before Congress, and files on the policy agendas of sitting
            administrations. WOLA files provide evidence of WOLA's diverse activities, including:
            organizing Congressional delegations to Latin American countries and visits to
            Washington D.C. for Latin American constituencies; organizing conferences and programs
            to increase dialogue and awareness of various concerns in Latin America; and efforts to
            influence the United States' foreign policy through lobbying. Larger subseries may have
            additional groups; common examples include Background Files, Economy and Development,
            Politics and Government, and Printed Material. With the exception of alphabetized
            printed material, the original order and organization of files has been maintained to
            the extent possible. A subseries on <emph render="bold">Latin America</emph> containing
            files that do not focus exclusively on one country completes the Geographic series. See
            subseries descriptions below for details on contents and arrangement.</p>

            <p>Clippings, correspondence, and files primarily concerned with Argentina's stance
              towards political expression and human rights. Most material is dated between the late
              1970s and the early 1980s. Prominent topics include cases of extrajudicial
              imprisonment of dissidents by the government, several of which were brought before the
              Interamerican Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). In addition, some files document
              controversies over proposed sales of arms to Argentina by the United States and
              Argentina's support of conservative authoritarian regimes in El Salvador and Bolivia.
              Material was created by WOLA staff, including Rachel Nield and Coletta Youngers.</p>

            <p>Files and clippings on the Bolivian state and economy, almost all of which concern
              drug policy in some way. Many of these document U.S. relations with Bolivia,
              particularly with respect to military aid to combat drug processing and trafficking.
              Some documents and reports also examine Bolivian economic development in the context
              of creating economically viable alternatives for coca farmers. Finally, human rights
              abuses, most at the hands of foreign-controlled drug cartels, are documented.
              Additional Bolivia-related material may be found in the Drug Policy Subseries of the
              Initiatives and Activities Series.</p>

                Ahern</emph> and those created by <emph render="bold">WOLA</emph>. The majority of
              the material in this subseries chronicles the events surrounding the 1973 coup that
              installed General Augusto Pinochet as leader of Chile and the ramifications of this
              event over several decades. The <emph render="bold">Patrick Ahern Files</emph> consist
              of material collected by Ahern, a Catholic priest with an interest in liberation
              theology. The bulk of this grouping consists of printed material from a range of
              Chilean and internationally based sources, many of which predate or run concurrently
              with the coup. Material in the subject files subgrouping documents the immediate
              aftermath of the coup and the response of key actors in the United States. <emph
                render="bold">WOLA Files</emph> contain clippings, press releases, correspondence,
              and reports on human rights abuses and the Chilean political environment. These focus
              on U.S. relations with Chile including the bombing of exiled diplomat Orlando Letelier
              in Washington D.C. and the changing political climate in Chile in the late 1980s and
              early 1990s. Finally, files from the 2000s chronicle international attempts to bring
              Pinochet to trial for human rights abuses and the Chilean state's response to these
              efforts.</p>

                his assistant Ronnie Moffitt and international efforts to bring their killers to
                justice. In addition some files document human rights abuses of the junta helmed by
                Pinochet, among these a three-volume copy of the report issued by the Chilean Truth
                and Reconciliation Commission. Efforts of human rights groups and some in the
                international community to bring Pinochet to trial in the late 1990s and early 2000s
                are documented as well.</p>

            <p>Organized in the following folder groups: <emph render="bold">Human Rights</emph>;
                <emph render="bold">Politics and Government</emph>; <emph render="bold">Printed
                Material</emph>; <emph render="bold">U.S. Relations</emph>; and <emph render="bold"
                >WOLA Files</emph>. United States drug control policy (commonly called the War on
              Drugs) forms the backdrop against which nearly all files are set. Files chronicle the
              Colombian government's attempts to maintain control within its borders against drug
              cartels and guerilla and paramilitary groups. The United States' role in Colombia,
              both as a military advisor and as a critic of alleged human rights abuses by the
              military are documented. <emph render="bold">Human Rights</emph> files examine
              specific cases of rights violations as well as more general reports by Colombian and
              U.S.-based organizations. Material in the <emph render="bold">Politics and
                Government</emph> grouping cover domestic issues in Colombia, including elections,
              the administration of justice, and the faltering peace process between the state and
              the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia–Ejército del Pueblo (FARC-EP or FARC)
              the largest guerilla faction in Colombia. <emph render="bold">Printed Material</emph>
              consists of reports and serials. Most are published by U.S.-based institutions
              (including WOLA), although some by Colombian government agencies and human rights
              groups appear as well. Files on <emph render="bold">U.S. Relations</emph> with
              Colombia include testimony before Congress; correspondence by members of Congress to
              other leaders in the U.S. and Colombia; and numerous debates about foreign aid to
              Colombia to combat drug cultivation and distribution. WOLA's efforts to shape the
              policy debate in the United States are documented in <emph render="bold">WOLA
                Files</emph>, the largest grouping. Correspondence with officials in the U.S. and
              Colombia, reports and information relevant to pending legislation (known to WOLA staff
              as "Hill drops"), material related to conferences and programs organized by WOLA, and
              files coordinating delegations to Colombia make up the bulk of these files. One
              compact disc entitled <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Rehenes de las
                FARC</title> and one videocassette complete the subseries. Material created by WOLA
              staff, including Charles Call, Jason Hagen, Tina Hodges, Winifred Tate, and Coletta
              Youngers, whose names can often be found in materials or on file folders. Additional
              files related to Colombia may be found in the Drug Policy Subseries of the Initiatives
              and Activities Series.</p>

            <p>Files on Costa Rican economy and politics, many relating explicitly to the Contra
              War. Covers the 1986 election of Óscar Arias Sánchez and Costa Rica's ongoing issues
              with debt service related to development aid. Relations with the U.S. figure
              prominently in this subseries, with respect to economic and military aid and Costa
              Rica's efforts to remain a neutral party in the Nicaraguan conflict. Also contains
              some material describing the state of human rights in Costa Rica, particularly
              relating to the counter-revolutionary forces (often called "Contras") that used Costa
              Rica's northern border as a staging area for incursions into Nicaragua. While nearly
              all files explicitly refer to Costa Rica, a few relate to the larger surrounding
              region and the Contra War more generally. Researchers interested in the Nicaraguan
              conflict should consult subseries on Nicaragua and Honduras as well.</p>

            <p>Pertains chiefly to the U.S. trade embargo with Cuba. Organized into the following
              folder groups: <emph render="bold">Human Rights,</emph><emph render="bold">Other
                Material,</emph> and <emph render="bold">U.S. Relations.</emph><emph render="bold"
                >Human Rights</emph> is the smallest group in the subseries and contains files and
              reports related to Cuban human rights concerns, particularly the topics of political
              dissidents and religious freedom. A number of general reports from human rights
              organizations are included as well. <emph render="bold">Other Material</emph> consists
              of general files related to Cuban political history; files associated with conferences
              and seminars, the bulk organized by WOLA; documents on Cuba's relationship with the
              (non-U.S.) international community; and files related to the status of churches in
              Cuba, particularly the 1998 visit by the Pope.</p>
            <p>The bulk of the subseries is housed in the <emph render="bold">U.S. Relations</emph>
              grouping. Most of this material relates to details of the longstanding U.S.-imposed
              trade and travel embargo. Files in this group document escalations of the embargo
              policy, particularly the 1996 Helms-Burton Act (also known as LIBERTAD), as well as
              calls for its easement or removal by members of Congress, WOLA, and other
              organizations. Many files concern the removal of restrictions on humanitarian aid to
              Cuba, travel restrictions to the island for U.S. citizens, and efforts by farm lobbies
              to open Cuba to U.S. agricultural exports. Additional files document allegations of
              Cuban links to terrorist activities by U.S. officials after September 11, 2001 as well
              as arguments against these claims. Finally, copies of a declassified 1962 Defense
              Department memorandum outlining the possible instigation of armed conflict with Cuba
              (Box 107) and declassified reports on the trial of anti-Castro fighter Orlando Bosch
              in Venezuela are included. WOLA staff, particularly Liah Rosenblum and Geoff Thale
              assembled and maintained material in this subseries.</p>

              government and the leftist political party, the Frente Farabundo Martí para la
              Liberación Nacional (FMLN). The subseries is separated into <emph render="bold"
                >Economic Development</emph>, <emph render="bold">Human Rights</emph>, and <emph
                render="bold">Other Material</emph>. The <emph render="bold">Economic
                Development</emph> subseries includes newsletters, pamphlets, and other writings on
              development in El Salvador as well as reconstruction after Hurricane Mitch in 1998 and
              the devastating earthquake of 2001. Documents relating to agrarian reform, land
              transfers, and outsourcing of U.S. jobs to El Salvador also are found in Economic
              Development, as are records of international financial aid not contingent on human
              rights issues. Within <emph render="bold">Human Rights</emph> are records of
              international aid dependent upon the address of human rights violations (especially by
              the government's armed forces). Also encompasses clippings, formal reports,
              correspondence, and documentation of WOLA events revolving around elections,
              democratization, immigration, labor, judicial reform, criminal codes, and reform of
              the PNC (La Policía Nacional Civil). The majority of the material pertaining to U.S.
              foreign policy towards El Salvador appears in Human Rights, and these boxes contain
              original documents from the truth commission, the United Nations Observer Mission in
              El Salvador (ONUSAL), the peace accords of 1992, and the FMLN. One VHS cassette
              produced by the American Jewish World Service appears at the beginning of this
              grouping. <emph render="bold">Other Material</emph> consists of issues of the
              Salvadoran magazine <title type="simple" render="italic">Tendencias </title>dated from
              1991-1994 as well as copies of <title type="simple" render="italic">El Salvador
                Proceso</title>. Conference material, files on elections and the solidarity group El
              Salvador Policy Project complete the subseries. While nearly all files refer
              exclusively to El Salvador, a few also address Nicaragua-centered Contra War. Material
              has been arranged as received and only separated insofar as was necessary to generate
              the categories described above.</p>

            <p>Spans the dates 1965-2007 with the bulk of the material dated between 1978 and 2005.
              Subseries is divided into the following folder groups: <emph render="bold">Economy and
                Development</emph>; <emph render="bold">Human Rights</emph>; <emph render="bold"

              and <emph render="bold">WOLA Files</emph>. Material details the political situation in
              Guatemala from domestic and international perspectives. Most of the files in this
              subseries relate to the conflict between guerilla groups and the government that began
              in 1960 through the 1996 peace accords and the tenuous process of building civil
              society afterward. The bulk of the material concerns human rights in some way. WOLA
              personnel who created and maintained material in this subseries include Adriana
              Beltran, Hugh Byrne, Rachel Garst, Susan Peacock, and Bonnie Tenneriello, whose names
              sometimes appear in materials or on folders.</p>

              <p>Case files on instances of human rights violations as well as general reports by
                various local and international human rights organizations. Most case files document
                abuses by forces linked to the Guatemalan military, including the rural Patrullas de
                Autodefensa Civil (PAC), assassinations of clergy and political figures, forced
                disappearances and torture of prisoners, and the so-called <emph

                rights abuses by guerilla forces may also be found here. Prominent human rights
                cases include the murder of Guatemalan anthropologist Myrna Mack Chang (in whose
                memory Fundacion Myrna Mack, a key partner organization of WOLA's was founded), the
                massacre at Xaman, the rape and torture of Sr. Diana Ortiz, and the assassination of
                Bishop Juan José Gerardi. Human rights organizations whose reports appear in this
                grouping, most based outside Guatemala, include Human Rights Watch, Amnesty
                International and the Guatemalan Human Rights Commission. Because the resolutions to
                some of these cases became seminal components of the peace process, researchers are
                strongly encouraged to consult files in the Peace Process grouping for human rights
                issues.</p>

              <p>Files document facets of the transition to civil government initiated as a result
                of accords between the umbrella guerilla group Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional
                Guatemalteca (URNG) and the Guatemalan government in 1994-1996. These include press
                clippings about the peace accords as well as copies of them; reports and information
                related to the United Nations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights and of
                Compliance with the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in Guatemala (MINUGUA);
                the Comisión para el Esclarecimiento Histórico (CEH), Guatemala's truth and
                reconciliation commission; and files related to government efforts to bring the
                military under civil control. This grouping also includes files related to judicial
                proceedings stemming from acts committed during the decades of conflict that
                preceded the peace process as well as instances of witness intimidation by parties
                wishing to keep cases from coming to trial. Intimidation and abuse of refugees
                returning to the countryside from Mexico comprise another major strand of human
                rights cases that became part of the peace process.</p>

                Montt and Alfonso Antonio Portillo Cabrera. Many files document the Centro de
                Estudios Estrategicos para la Estabilidad Nacional (ESTNA), which in part

              <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
              <p>Covers the extent of the United States' involvement in Guatemala, from direct
                military and economic aid to numerous and often substantiated claims of clandestine
                involvement by the CIA in the training and operation of the Guatemalan military.
                Congressional financial and political support of the Guatemalan peace process as
                well as files related to diplomatic delegations appear here. The majority of the
                material chronicles the United States' multifaceted relationship with the Guatemalan
                military. These include: a few declassified CIA and State Department documents;
                files on Congressional debates about military and economic aid to Guatemala; and
                military training at the School of the Americas (SOA), by the CIA, and through the
                International Military Education and Training (IMET) program.</p>

              <p>Files document WOLA's activities related to Guatemala, including reports, drafts,
                and memoranda on the political and human rights situation there, background files,
                conference materials, and numerous letters to partner organizations in the United

                either as part of correspondence or as the creator of the files. Because of the
                diverse nature of WOLA's work, topics covered in this grouping touch all of the
                other groupings. One audio recording of the WOLA conference <title type="simple"

            <p>Files, reports, and clippings, mostly on human rights. Human rights abuses include
              reports of "disappearances," torture, and killings by the military as well as more
              general reports on the status of human right in Honduras. The tenor and level of the

              files on elections and the administration of justice by the state. Some earlier files
              directly and indirectly refer to the Nicaragua-centered Contra War as well as Honduran
              relations with the United States, including U.S. links to the infamous Battalion 316,
              which became well-known after a series of newspaper articles in the <title

              several files on the National Police, responsible for a significant amount of human
              rights abuses in Honduras. The other files in this subseries are miscellaneous files,
              some created by WOLA and some photocopies of reports created by Honduran agencies. One
              videocassette, <title type="simple" render="italic">Zoned for Slavery</title>, an

                  background material on the history of Mexican electoral process and includes a
                  simplified timeline. There are a few files of material on parties such as PRI and
                  PAN, documenting their candidates and stating their position on electoral reform.
                  Includes WOLA's proposal for a grant to send another elections delegation to

            <p>Chiefly concerns Nicaraguan politics and government. Files in this subseries do not
              directly address the 1979 revolution or its immediate aftermath, but to later events.
              Key topics include elections in 1990, 1996, and 2001; peace negotiations between the
              Nicaraguan state and rebel groups, and some assessments of the United States' role in
              Nicaraguan political affairs. Files are separated into the following folder groups:
                <emph render="bold">Human Rights</emph>, <emph render="bold">Peace Process</emph>,
                <emph render="bold">Politics and Government</emph>, <emph render="bold">Printed
                Material</emph>, and <emph render="bold">WOLA Files</emph>. Most files in <emph
                render="bold">Human Rights</emph> refer to abuses committed during hostilities
              between the ruling Sandinista (Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional, FSLN)
              government and the various counter insurgent groups commonly called "Contras." Reports
              on the FSLN's treatment of political dissidents also appear here. <emph render="bold"
                >Peace Process</emph> files include copies of accords negotiated to end the Contra
              War as well as reports by international observers. The largest grouping, <emph
                render="bold">Politics and Government</emph> contains clippings, reports, and
              government documents related to national elections and constitutional law. Major
              election observers include the International Human Rights Law Group (IHRLG) and
              Hemisphere Initiatives. <emph render="bold">Printed Material</emph> focuses on
              Nicaraguan politics and government as well as human rights and includes a mostly
              complete run of <title type="simple" render="italic">Barricada Internacional</title>
              from July 1993-September 1996. Finally, <emph render="bold">WOLA Files</emph> consist
              of correspondence and draft reports by WOLA and partner organizations attempting to
              influence U.S. policy towards Nicaragua. U.S.-Nicaraguan relations are a major
              component of this grouping, and some discussion of the role of the CIA in the Contra
              War can be found here. Files in this grouping document WOLA's efforts to influence
              policy as the shifting political climate of each presidential administration created
              different circumstances. Because the Contra War was international in nature,
              researchers interested in this subject are encouraged to consult subseries on Costa
              Rica and Honduras as well. Videocassette on Nicaraguan sweatshops and property rights
              can be found at the end of the subseries.</p>

                render="bold">Human Rights</emph>, with information on human rights abuses, cases,
              trials, the judiciary, and organizations (the latter is arranged in alphabetical order
              and includes Amnesty International, America Watch, Centre de Documentation Paysanne du

              focused on the congressional record (approximately 1976-1985) and U.S. Ambassador

            <p>Files in this subseries are generally related to the administration of Alberto
              Fujimori (1990-2000) and responses to it by human rights groups in Perú as well as
              associated solidarity groups in the United States. Most are concerned with efforts of
              groups, chiefly WOLA, to raise awareness or encourage action on human rights abuses
              attributed to the Fujimori regime. The vast majority of material was created or

                Derechos Humanos (CNDDH), the Perú Peace Network (PPN), and Other Organizations and
                Cases. The CNDDH is an umbrella human rights organization based in Lima, Perú that
                organizes and helps coordinate the activities of over fifty human rights groups
                working in Perú and is one of WOLA's primary partners in Perú. The PPN is a
                Missouri-based solidarity organization with which WOLA is affiliated. Other groups
                represented in this section include the Asociacion Pro Derechos Humanos (APRODEH),
                Defensoria del Pueblo, Amnesty International, and Americas Watch. Specific cases
                include files on human rights advocate and Partido Democrático Descentralista
                co-founder Javier Diez Canseco; the 1997 Japanese Embassy hostage crisis; lawsuits
                filed against Texaco for environmental damage in Perú; Peruvian army intelligence
                officer and alleged torturer Tomas Ricardo Anderson Kohatsu; and the massacre at Los

            <p>Mainly concerned with political events and human rights issues that arose during
              Uruguay's transition from military to civilian rule in the 1980s. The subseries is
              separated into the following folder groups: <emph render="bold">Background and
                Issues</emph>, <emph render="bold">Cases</emph>, <emph render="bold">Political

                >WOLA Files</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Other Material</emph>. The <emph
                render="bold">Background and Issues</emph> group contains some research about the
              political history of Uruguay, but it is mainly composed of files about issues
              contemporaneous with WOLA's work there in the 1980s, including elections, human
              rights, the military, the press, and the 1989 referendum on the "Ley de Caducidad de
              la Pretensión Punitiva del Estado" (granting amnesty for many human rights violations
              committed under the military dictatorship of 1973-1985). The <emph render="bold">Cases
              </emph>files comprise correspondence and research about the 1976 assassinations of
              Uruguayan politicians Zelmar Michelini and Héctor Gutiérrez Ruiz. The <emph
                render="bold">Political Parties</emph> folders contain printed materials about the
              Frente Amplio, the Partido Colorado, and various communist and socialist parties in
              Uruguay. Journals and newsletters from various NGOs make up the bulk of the <emph

              represented here include <title type="simple" render="italic">Aportes</title>, CELADU

              Economía Humana), IELSUR (Instituto de Estudios Legales y Sociales del Uruguay), and
              SERPAJ (Servicio Páz y Justicia). The <emph render="bold">WOLA Files</emph> consist
              mainly of newsletters, press releases, and other publications generated by WOLA, but
              also include correspondence, contact lists, and other office files. Finally, documents
              gathered under <emph render="bold">Other Material</emph> include general
              correspondence, letters to the United States Congress, and a variety of printed
              material and reports about Uruguay's history, politics, and current events. Arranged
              mainly as received, in groups of color-coded files, except for Other Material, which
              consists of folders that were either too few to constitute a group or whose
              organizational theme could not be determined.</p>

            <p>Clippings, files and printed material on human rights, politics, and economic policy

              opponents. Files on Venezuelan economic policy are included, particularly concerning

              human rights organizations including Red de Apoyo, PROVEA, and the Comité de

                render="bold">General Files</emph> include clippings on human rights, economic, and
              political issues across individual states. Some of these files address particular
              regions, including the Southern Cone and the Andes, while others refer to South
              America or Central America. As with the rest of the collection, most files are
              oriented around United States policy toward Latin America. However, the Interamerican
              Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) and the Organization of American States (OAS)
              figure more prominently in General Files. Conference and seminar-related documentation
              also appear in this group. <emph render="bold">Printed Material</emph> includes
              publications with the same broad scope as found in General Files. The largest
              component is a mostly complete run of Central America Report dated between 1985 and
              1996. Other publications include a very early report by Americas Watch and numerous
              WOLA reports. Two boxes of printed material are unsorted. One videocassette, <title

            <p>Files for WOLA's Central America Advocacy Training Program (ATP). The ATP's primary
              objective is to build the capacity of local civil society organizations to advocate
              for rights protection in their respective societies. Divided into folder groups for

              topics, including office correspondence; grants and funding documents; project
              planning and external reviews of projects; office memoranda; and some research files.
              The <emph render="bold">Project Files</emph> mostly reflect the work of WOLA staff
              working in Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Material includes conference and
              workshop agendas; training and educational materials; and numerous project proposals
              for various Central American civil society organizations. Major topical groups include
              police reform, the administration of justice, and violence against women.
              Administrative files created by Central America-based offices may be found in the

            <p>Files primarily relating to U.S. efforts to combat drug cultivation in the Americas
              and its sale in this country. Divided into the following four groups: <emph
                render="bold">Drugs, Democracy, and Human Rights Project</emph>; <emph render="bold"
                >Research Files</emph>; <emph render="bold">U.S. Relations</emph>; and <emph

                Rights Project</emph> (DDHR) files specifically pertain to the WOLA initiative of
              the same name, directed by Coletta Youngers and Eileen Rosin. The bulk of the material
              consists of drafts of papers and book chapters written for inclusion in <title
                type="simple" render="italic">Drugs and Democracy in Latin America: US
                Policy</title>, an edited volume produced as part of the project. <emph
                render="bold">Research Files</emph> include notes, clippings, articles, and reports
              collected by WOLA staff for the DDHR Project and other activities. Topics covered in
              this group include aerial fumigation of coca crops, drug-related money laundering, and
              aerial interdiction of planes smuggling drugs out of South America. Most files
              specifically refer to Perú, though documents on Colombia and Bolivia are also well
              represented. This group also includes a small run of issues of <title type="simple"
                render="italic">Coca Bulletin</title>, and English language newsletter promoting
              crop substitution printed in Bolivia. <emph render="bold">U.S. Relations</emph> files
              directly relate to the policies and actions of various offices of the federal
              government. The bulk of these are files on various Congressional hearings on pending
              U.S. legislation or oversight of Executive Branch activities such at those by the Drug
              Enforcement Administration (DEA) or the Executive Office of National Drug Control
              Policy (ONDCP). Other files concern the CIA (most relating to allegations of drug
              profiteering in connection with the Nicaragua-centered Contra War), FBI, and various
              branches of the U.S. military. Numerous documents declassified through Freedom of
              Information Act requests are included, most concerning the ONDCP. <emph render="bold"
                >WOLA Files</emph> include administrative planning documents, internal
              correspondence and memoranda, articles by WOLA staff, and material related to
              conferences on drug policy coordinated and/or attended by WOLA. Documents created by
              WOLA staff, including Charles Call, Eileen Rosin, John Walsh, and Coletta Youngers.
              Researchers interested in drug policy should also consult Geographic subseries for
              Bolivia, Colombia, and Mexico. The <title type="simple" render="italic">Coletta
                Youngers Papers</title>, also held by the Rubenstein Library at Duke, also contain

            <p>Files documenting the responses of WOLA, the larger NGO community, and state
              governments to the devastation left in the wake of Hurricane Mitch, a massive storm
              that hit Central America in 1998. Files concern the countries most directly hit by the
              storm, most prominently Nicaragua and Honduras but also El Salvador and Guatemala.
              Material in this subseries chronicle WOLA's efforts to advocate for additional aid
              from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and to persuade
              USAID and other government agencies to sign on to the principles outlined at a meeting
              of world governments and NGOs in Stockholm, Sweden. The Stockholm Principles proposed
              a comprehensive restructuring of hurricane-affected countries that included enlarging
              and consolidating democratic civil society, improving agricultural and environmental
              practices, and reducing foreign debt. Printed material and reports by WOLA partners in
              the region, such as Confederación De Pueblos Autóctonos De Honduras (CONPAH) and
              Coordinadora Civil para la Emergencia y la Reconstrucción (CCER) are also included.
              Additionally, some files on appropriations and responses from the U.S. Congress and
              Executive Branch and the United Nations can be found here. Major topics include
              sustainable land practices; the plight of indigenous Central Americans and those of
              African ancestry; international donor nations and debt service reduction; and efforts
              to reduce prodigious gap between the wealthiest and poorest in the region. Files were
              created by WOLA staff including Vicki Gass, Eric Olson, and Geoff Thale. Geographic
              subseries for affected countries, particularly Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador
              contain some additional Hurricane Mitch-related files.</p>

              particularly with respect to drugs and foreign military and development aid. Consists
              of correspondence, Congressional debates, newspaper editorials, and memoranda related
              to pending U.S. legislation. Contains many information packets for Congressional
              policy aids known internally as "Hill drops." In addition to correspondence to members
              of Congress, a few letters to Secretaries of State, President Clinton, and foreign
              heads of state are also included. Major topics include the process of certifying the
              cooperation of foreign countries in U.S. anti-narcotics programs, particularly with
              respect to Mexico and Colombia; military aid and training assistance; Hurricane Mitch;
              and numerous efforts to protect funding for the Interamerican Development Bank's (IDB)
              Fund for Special Operations (FSO), which provides financial assistance to the weakest
              Latin American economies. Additional files on WOLA's legislative work can be found in
              individual Geographic or Initiatives and Activities Subseries, generally in folder
              groups for U.S. Relations or WOLA Files. Assembled and maintained by WOLA staff,

            country in alphabetical order, after which follow a series of groupings related to
            specific conferences, or to topics such as Hurricane Mitch, drug policy, rights and
            development, and security. Approximately two boxes of cassettes at the end of the series
