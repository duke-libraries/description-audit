         <abstract id="aspace_4b445d7c3ed4c2821a91b0c2e2866305">Leo Bogart was an applied
            sociologist and mass media expert who was Vice President and General Manager of the
            Newspaper Advertising Bureau (NAB) from 1960-1989. In his career with the NAB, Bogart
            pioneered new methodologies in newspaper marketing research and led two major projects
            during the mid 1970s-1989 to bolster the ailing newspaper industry, the Newspaper
            Readership Project and the Future of Advertising Project. He was also a prolific author
            and public speaker, and published 195 articles and 14 books, and delivered over 150
            speeches from 1943-2005. The Leo Bogart Papers span the years 1912-2005 and document
            Bogart's professional work with the Newspaper Advertising Bureau; as a mass media
            expert; and as an author and public speaker. The collection includes correspondence,
            clippings, articles, speeches, books, journals, chapters, drafts, proposals, notes,
            reports, scrapbooks, resumes, interviews, schedules, programs, pamphlets, administrative
            records, research materials, publications, promotional materials, ephemera, yearbooks,
            student papers, military records, photographs, negatives, and slides. Materials
            represent Bogart's professional work as Vice President and General Manager of the
            Newspaper Advertising Bureau, as well as his early employment with Standard Oil (New
            Jersey), McCann-Erickson, and Revlon, Inc.; as a prolific author and public speaker; as
            a Senior Fellow with the Gannett Center for Media Studies at Columbia University; and as
            a mass media consultant with the Innovation International Media Consulting Group. The
            bulk of files relate to research on U.S. markets, although some files do cover
            international research projects. Topics include newspaper marketing research; newspaper
            readership; newspaper advertising; television and society; critiques of mass media;
            social science research methodology; and international newspapers in emerging markets.
            The collection also documents Bogart's early experiences as a student and as a soldier
            in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II, which formed the basis for several of
            his writing projects.</abstract>

         <p>The Leo Bogart Papers span the years 1912-2005 and document Bogart's professional work
            with the Newspaper Advertising Bureau; as a mass media expert; and as an author and
            public speaker. The collection includes correspondence, clippings, articles, speeches,
            books, journals, chapters, drafts, proposals, notes, reports, scrapbooks, resumes,
            interviews, schedules, programs, pamphlets, administrative records, research materials,
            publications, promotional materials, ephemera, yearbooks, student papers, military
            records, photographs, negatives, and slides. Materials represent Bogart's professional
            work as Vice President and General Manager of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, as well
            as his early employment with Standard Oil (New Jersey), McCann-Erickson, and Revlon,
            Inc.; as a prolific author and public speaker; as a Senior Fellow with the Gannett
            Center for Media Studies at Columbia University; and as a mass media consultant with the
            Innovation International Media Consulting Group. The bulk of files relate to research on
            U.S. markets, although some files do cover international research projects. Topics
            include newspaper marketing research; newspaper readership; newspaper advertising;
            television and society; critiques of mass media; social science research methodology;
            and international newspapers in emerging markets. The collection also documents Bogart's
            early experiences as a student and as a soldier in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during
            World War II, which formed the basis for several of his writing projects.</p>

         <p>In addition, approximately 110 computer discs were removed from the collection and
            stored on an electronic server (M:\Processed\Bogart, Leo). The majority of electronic
            files consist of articles, drafts, chapters and presentations that duplicate materials
            housed in the collection in paper form.</p>

               <p>The <emph render="bold">Newspaper Advertising Bureau (NAB) Subseries</emph>
                  documents Bogart's twenty-nine year executive career with the Newspaper
                  Advertising Bureau (NAB), the advertising and marketing organization for the
                  newspaper industry. Bogart began work with the NAB as Vice President of Marketing
                  Planning and Research in 1960 and was promoted to Executive Vice President and
                  General Manager in 1966. Bogart was the architect of many of the major research
                  studies conducted during his tenure with the NAB. Bogart led two major research
                  projects, the Newspaper Readership Project from 1977-1983 and the Future of
                  Advertising Project from 1979-1988. The goal of the Newspaper Readership Project
                  was to make recommendations to reverse declines in newspaper readership that begun
                  in the 1920s and were threatening the vitality of the newspaper industry during
                  the 1970s and 1980s. The Future of Advertising Project was formed shortly
                  afterward to address newspapers' decline in national advertising revenues that
                  began in the 1960s due largely to the rise of television. Recommendations from the
                  Future of Advertising Project led to standardization in advertising formats and
                  invoices across newspapers. This subseries is divided into three sections: <emph
                     render="bold">General</emph>, <emph render="bold">Newspaper Readership

                  <p>After Bogart retired from the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, he was nominated a
                     fellow with the Gannett Center for Media Studies for the 1989-1990 academic
                     year. As a fellow, Bogart received support while completing his book <title
                        type="simple" render="italic">Commercial Culture: The Media System and the
                        Public Interest</title>. For materials related to this book, see the <emph
                        render="bold">Writings and Speeches Subseries</emph>. Bogart continued a
                     relationship with the Gannett Center, which became financially independent from
                     the Gannett Broadcasting Group in 1991 and was renamed the Freedom Forum Media
                     Studies Center. On behalf of the Freedom Forum, Bogart advised the <title
                        type="simple" render="italic">Oakland Tribune</title> on how to restructure
                     their business in 1991 and organized a newspaper advertising workshop in Russia
                     and Eastern Europe in 1992. </p>
                  <p>Bogart spent much of his late career sharing his newspaper industry and mass
                     media expertise. As Director and Senior Consultant for Innovation International
                     Media Consulting Group, Bogart advised newspapers, particularly in Spain, Latin
                     America, Russia, and Eastern Europe; and assessed the state of newspapers and
                     mass media for Innovation publications and conferences. Bogart also shared his
                     knowledge about the mass media with attorneys as a media expert in two very
                     public trials in the 1990s, <title type="simple" render="italic">Chandler v.
                        Jackson</title> (Michael Jackson child molestation lawsuit) and <title

                  <p>Documents Bogart's twenty-nine year executive career with the Newspaper
                     Advertising Bureau (NAB), the advertising and promotion organization for the
                     newspaper industry. Bogart began work with the NAB as Vice President of
                     Marketing Planning and Research in 1960 and was promoted to Executive Vice
                     President and General Manager in 1966. During his tenure with the NAB, Bogart
                     was the architect of most of the major research studies. Bogart led two major
                     research projects, the Newspaper Readership Project from 1977-1983 and the
                     Future of Advertising Project from 1979-1988. The goal of the Newspaper
                     Readership Project was to make recommendations to reverse declines in newspaper
                     readership that begun in the 1920s and were threatening the vitality of the
                     newspaper industry during the 1970s and 1980s. The Future of Advertising
                     Project was formed shortly afterward to address newspapers' decline in national
                     advertising revenues that began in the 1960s due largely to the rise of
                     television. Recommendations from the Future of Advertising Project led to
                     standardization in advertising formats and invoices across newspapers. This
                     subseries is divided into three sections: <emph render="bold">General</emph>,
                        <emph render="bold">Newspaper Readership Project</emph>, and <emph
