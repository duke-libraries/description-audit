      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The William Baumol papers document his career as an economist and artist. The collection
        provides an overview of his professional activities, including his research on the cost
        disease, unbalanced growth, productivity growth, entrepreneurship, increasing returns and
        international trade, anti-trust policy, contestable markets, market structure, macroeconomic
        theory, and interest rate and monetary theory, among other topics. Baumol's research and
        writings on the economics of the arts, undertaken and co-authored with his wife Hilda, are
        included in the collection.</p>
      <p>The collection also documents his collaboration and communication with prominent economists
        such as Maurice Allais, Gary Becker, Alan Blinder, George Dantzig, Robert Dorfman, Milton
        Friedman, John Kenneth Galbraith, Ralph Gomory, Frank Hahn, Roy Harrod, John Hicks, Ursula
        Hicks, Samuel Hollander, Nicholas Kaldor, Harold Kuhn, Abba Lerner, Jacob Marschak, Don
        Patinkin, Lionel Robbins, Joan Robinson, Paul Samuelson, Ralph Turvey, Jacob Viner, and
        Edward Wolff, among others. Of note is Baumol's longtime collaboration with, and extensive
        support received from, Sue Anne Batey Blackman.</p>
      <p>Along with his scholarship and writings, the collection documents Baumol's leadership roles
        at the Berkley Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation and the C.V. Starr Center for
        Applied Economics at New York University, as well as his extensive expert witness and
        consulting activities for the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission,
        the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Joint Economic Committee, and the Senate Judiciary
        Committee, among others. Baumol's consulting was often done through the companies Alderson
        and Sessions, Mathematica, and Consultants in Industry Economics. His notable expert witness
        testimonies revolved around regulation in telecommunications (particularly the ATT
        monopoly), airline ticket prices and sales practices, pricing of railroad freight shipping,
        and other topics.</p>
      <p>Materials from Baumol's teaching at Princeton and New York University, departmental, and
        committee work are included in the collection. The collection also contains samples of
        Baumol's artwork, including sketches and paintings.</p>

      <head>Arrangement note</head>
      <p>PROCESSING NOTE: The materials received by Duke University arrived from Professor Baumol's
        offices at Princeton, New York University, and from his private residence. These were
        treated as one single accession and the materials from all three shipments have been
        consolidated. Hence, while the original organization has been mostly preserved at the folder
        level, at the box level this is not the case. Wherever possible the original folder labels
        were used in organizing the collection. Notable exceptions to this are the material in the
        Legal Testimony subseries and materials on the performing arts, government projects, and
        industry consulting as the bulk of this material was received loose. It was not possible to
        map every digital file recovered from floppy disks to particular projects, writings, or
        other files. In these cases generic classifiations were made in the arrangement.</p>

          <p>Contains chronological and name files on Baumol's correspondence with various
            individuals. Correspondence from the earlier decades of Baumol's career was maintained
            in chronological folders, while name folders were reserved for only some correspondents.
            Correspondence with notable individuals has been organized into name folders where
            appropriate, however, correspondence with some notable individuals remains in
            chronological folders to maintain coherence where conversations took place between
            multiple individuals. Correspondents of note include: Maurice Allais, Gary Becker,
            George Dantzig, Robert Dorfman, Milton Friedman, John Kenneth Galbraith, Ralph Gomory,
            Frank Hahn, Roy Harrod, John Hicks, Ursula Hicks, Samuel Hollander, Nicholas Kaldor,
            Harold Kuhn, Abba Lerner, Jacob Marschak, Don Patinkin, Lionel Robbins, Joan Robinson,
            Paul Samuelson, Ralph Turvey, Jacob Viner, and Edward Wolff.</p>
          <p>Much of Baumol's correspondence for specific research projects was originally organized
            with his files for the published work or with the relevant research materials. To
            maintain the original organization, additional correspondence of this kind can be found
            in the Writings and Research and Notes series.</p>
