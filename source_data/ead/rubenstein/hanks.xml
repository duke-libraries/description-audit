         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The papers of Nancy Hanks span the years 1894-1987 with the bulk occurring during the
            1940s to 1983. Included are correspondence; minutes; reports; typed, mimeographed, and
            printed material; financial papers; clippings; mail logs; telephone records; calendars;
            office files; interviews, questionnaires; and diaries. In addition there are scrapbooks,
            pictures, photograph albums, slides, audio cassettes, videocassettes, and electronic
            documents. One series contains awards, honorary degrees, and memorabilia.</p>
         <p>The Nancy Hanks collection is useful as a study of the development of private and
            governmental arts programs, in particular through the National Endowment for the Arts
            (NEA), and the personal life and career (1950s-1970s) of an upper-class single woman.
            Arts and the federal government is a recurrent theme. The collection also contains
            information about a variety of arts organizations in which Hanks was involved, often as
            a board member. Although the papers here document both her personal and professional
            life and present a balanced account, there are relatively few professional papers in the
            collection concerning her early career, 1951-1968.</p>
         <p>The private life of Nancy Hanks is chiefly documented in the <emph render="bold"
               >Personal Series</emph>. Although there are no diaries in the collection, the letters
            she wrote to her parents from the 1940s through the 1970s form a type of diary. This
            correspondence in the <emph render="bold">Personal Series</emph> often contains a
            detailed accounting of daily events from her college years at Duke University, where she
            majored in political science, and her early career in Washington, D.C., through the NEA
            years. Letters from her parents reveal their influence on her and often note their
            advice to her. Other correspondence is from friends, some during World War II, including
            extensive correspondence from 1946 to 1949 with William A. Carpenter, a former college
            friend. Other correspondents were Louis E. Reid, 1955-1961; John F. Watkins, 1949-1950;
            and Duke University Dean of Chapel James T. Cleland, 1949-1969. The financial papers in
            that series reveal her wealth, such as in real estate and stocks, as well as her long
            illness. There are gaps in the tax returns and bank statements from 1966-1975 and after
            1979.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Duke University</emph>, <emph render="bold">Bryan and Virginia
               Hanks</emph>, <emph render="bold">Larry Hanks</emph>, and <emph render="bold"
               >Pictures Series</emph> all complete the story. In the <emph render="bold">Duke
               University Series</emph>, Hanks' financial contributions to the university are
            documented, including the Hanks Family Endowment Fund and the Hanks Family Chapel
            Fund.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Bryan and Virginia Hanks Series</emph> and <emph render="bold"
               >Larry Hanks Series</emph> contain records of Hanks' parents, Bryan Cayce Hanks,
            Virginia Wooding Hanks, and brother Lawrence (Larry) Wooding Hanks. Included in the
               <emph render="bold">Bryan and Virginia Hanks Series</emph> are late-nineteenth
            century documents, letters of Hanks' father from France during World War I and from a
            Colorado sanatarium, 1931-1932, as well as their courtship letters. Bryan Hanks was a
            lawyer in New York, Miami, and Fort Worth, and became president of Florida Power and
            Light Company in 1937. Also there is some Hanks and Wooding families history, including
            a few papers of Benjamin Franklin Wooding, Nancy's maternal grandfather. He was a
            medical doctor and inventor who developed an automatic train control device and
            automatic block controls for prevention of railroad accidents. The <emph render="bold"
               >Larry Hanks Series</emph> tells the story of the early death of Nancy Hanks' younger
            brother, who was killed in a truck accident in California in June, 1950 at the age of
            eighteen while a student at Southwestern University.</p>
         <p>In this collection it is primarily the NEA portion of Hanks' career, 1968-1977 during
            the Nixon and Ford years, that is represented. However, there is some information in the
            letters to Hanks' parents in the <emph render="bold">Personal Series</emph> which
            reflects her early work, 1951-1968. During her tenure at NEA there were vast increases
            in NEA funding. The NEA was established in 1965 with the National Endowment for the
            Humanities as components of the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities. In
            the <emph render="bold">National Endowment for the Arts Series </emph>there is a
            narrative entitled, "Ten Years for Tomorrow," which contains much biographical
            information about Hanks' NEA years. While at NEA Hanks delivered numerous speeches; in
            fact from 1971 to 1974 she made about 100 addresses. These years are also documented in
            the <emph render="bold">American Film Institute (AFI)</emph>, <emph render="bold"
               >Commission on Critical Choices for Americans</emph>, and <emph render="bold"
               >National Council on the Arts series</emph>, which depict related responsibilities of
            Hanks. AFI files document the organization's efforts to preserve the heritage and art of
            both film and television in America. National Council on the Arts files reflect programs
            in the areas of architecture, dance, education, expansion arts, literature, museums,
            music, visual arts, exhibitions, and theater. The <emph render="bold">Personal
               Series</emph>, <emph render="bold">Pictures Series</emph>, and <emph render="bold"
               >Awards and Memorabilia Series</emph> provide supplemental information. Letters Hanks
            wrote to her parents as well as other correspondence and notes in the <emph
               render="bold">Personal Series</emph> relating to the NEA show her continuing interest
            in the agency after retirement. Related papers for the NEA are housed at the National
            Archives.</p>
         <p>The alphabetical files in the <emph render="bold">Personal Series</emph> document her
            board work, memberships, and interest in a variety of organizations and institutions,
            including those related to the arts. They include the Awards in the Visual Arts,
            Commission on Museums for a new Century, Continental Oil Company (Conoco), the
            Conservation Foundation, the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., the
            Independent Sector, the Indo-U.S. Subcommission on Education and Culture, Partners for
            Livable Places, the Phillips Collection, Presidential Task Force on the Arts and
            Humanities, Salzburg Seminar in American Studies, Scholastic, Inc., and Board of Regents
            of the Smithsonian Institution. One measure of the public recognition of Hanks' work is
            the fact that during 1970 to 1981 she received 27 honorary doctoral degrees. The <emph
               render="bold">National Endowment for the Arts Series</emph> office files, <emph
               render="bold">Rockefeller Brothers Fund Series</emph>, and the <emph render="bold"
               >Personal Series</emph> alphabetical files all contain single folders for a variety
            of art, dance, and music organizations.</p>
         <p>Papers relating to Nelson Rockefeller are scattered throughout the collection. The <emph
               render="bold">Rockefeller Brothers Fund Series</emph> contains material relating to
            Nelson A., John D., 3rd, and Laurance. In the <emph render="bold">Personal Series</emph>
            is information on Nelson A. Rockefeller and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund; Hanks'
            correspondence with her parents also discusses her relationship with Nelson
            Rockefeller.</p>
         <p>There are papers in the collection that reflect both Hanks' retirement years as well as
            activities of colleagues after her death in 1983. One measure of Hanks' post-NEA
            involvement is that in 1982 she was on the boards of three corporations and a
            foundation, as well as being trustee or advisor for 20 non-profit organizations. Related
            materials are in the <emph render="bold">Rockefeller Brothers Fund</emph> and <emph
               render="bold">Friends of the Nancy Hanks Center, Inc. series</emph>. The papers of
            the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, where Hanks was a vice chairman, do not appear to provide
            a complete record of her work there. These files are probably scattered ones that she
            kept at home and often were not clearly defined. </p>
         <p> The U.S. government designated the Old Post Office space on Pennsylvania Avenue as the
            Nancy Hanks Center. The Friends of the Nancy Hanks Center was formed to initiate
            programs commemorating Hanks' life and advancing her values. Most of the interviews in
            this series were conducted by Peter Jessup, but Donna Mitchell conducted a number of
            them. Many of these interviews exist as electronic files and are available to
            researchers. These files are listed in the container list for the <emph render="bold"
               >Friends of the Nancy Hanks Center, Inc. Series</emph>. </p>
         <p>A related collection in the Duke University Special Collections Department is the Philip
            Hanes collection. In addition, Hanes material appears in the Hanks Papers in the <emph
               render="bold">Personal Series</emph> both under his name and in the Awards in the
            Visual Arts folders.</p>

               <p>The largest series, it includes mimeographed, printed, and typed material;
                  correspondence and memoranda; telephone records; calendars; clippings
                  (biographical information about Hanks); resumes; and trips information. Major
                  categories are the alphabetical files, chiefly <unitdate normal="1970/1979"
                     era="ce" calendar="gregorian" type="inclusive">1970s</unitdate>and <unitdate

                  alphabetically by correspondent's surname, then chronologically). Other categories
                  include financial papers, scrapbooks, speeches, and student papers (chiefly high
                  school and college). Financial papers include bank records, medical bills,
                  expenses and contributions such as to the National Republican Senatorial
                  Committee, tax returns, stock certificates and information, and real estate
                  papers. Arranged alphabetically by topic. Includes a small amount of restricted
                  material at the end.</p>

               <p>Cassette tapes, videocassettes, correspondence, questionnaires, and interviews.
                  Major categories: interviews (transcripts and cassette tapes), questionnaires, and
                  Old Post Office building. Interviews and questionnaires arranged alphabetically by
                  surname. Categories arranged alphabetically. Some interviews are restricted.</p>
               <p> Many of the interviews in this series also exist as electronic files dispersed
                  throughout twenty-one computer disks. Disks were assigned consecutive numbers
                  reflecting the original order in which they were received. If an interview has an
                  identical electronic file(s), the file is included in the alphabetical list below.
                  In such cases, the electronic file's name is listed, followed by the year of the
                  interview, then the file's disk (subdirectory) name.</p>
               <p>The contents of each disk was migrated to the Specoll server. Consequently, the
                  text of these electronic files is available in correspondingly numbered electronic
                  subdirectories. Consult a reference archivist for access to the electronic files.
