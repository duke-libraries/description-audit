        photographer, filmmaker, folklorist, professor of art and documentary studies, and former
        director of the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University. Collection consists of
        147 black-and-white and color photographs documenting the American South and China.
        Photographs from the South focus on religious sites, rituals, and communities in the
        Mississippi Delta region, as well as portraits of individuals, including portraits of
        Mississippi writer Larry Brown, and Southern landscapes. An additional documentary project
        from 2016 took Rankin to China, where he photographed semi-rural landscapes, often taken
        with high-rise buildings in the far distance or adjacent to industrial structures, as well
        as bridges and rivers, markets and live fish vendors, and a few street scenes. Finished
        prints range from 8x11 inch contact prints to 11x14, 16x20, and 20x24 large-format prints.
        Supporting materials include manuscripts, publications files, and two films, all deriving
        from Rankin's career and art practice. Includes a digital audio recording of a talk by
        Rankin at the exhibit opening of his work, "Near the Cross: Photographs from the Mississippi
        Delta." Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Tom Rankin served as the Director of the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University
        for three consecutive five-year terms until 2013, and is a Professor of the Practice in the
        Arts and Director of the Master of Fine Arts program at Duke University. A documentary
        photographer, filmmaker, writer, editor, and folklorist, he has been documenting and
        interpreting American culture, particularly in the South, for nearly twenty years. His
        photographic work has been published and widely exhibited. His most long-standing work has
        been to reveal through the documentary arts the culture and society of the Mississippi Delta
        region, where he also served as a faculty member of Delta State University and the
        University of Mississippi. He has returned many times since the 1980s to photograph the
        landscapes and people of the Mississippi Delta, most recently in 2011 after the great floods
        of that year. </p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The photographic work of Tom Rankin in this collection consists of 147 black-and-white and
        color photographs documenting the American South and China. Southern photographs were taken
        from 1980 to 2007, and focus on religious sites, rituals, and communities in the Mississippi
        Delta region; these prints form the largest series, "Sacred Space." Another body of work
        features portraits of Mississippi writer Larry Brown. A third body of work, "Portraits from
        the American South," offers views of Southern people, cultures, and landscapes in both color
        and black-and-white.</p>
      <p>An additional documentary project from 2016 took Rankin to China, where he photographed
        semi-rural landscapes, often taken with high-rise buildings in the far distance or adjacent
        to industrial structures, as well as bridges and rivers, markets and live fish vendors, and
        a few street scenes.</p>
      <p>Print sizes range from 11x14, 13x19, 16x20, and 20x24 inches, with many housed in window
        mats. Along with these prints, there are also 8x11 inch black-and-white matted contact
        prints. All titles were created by the photographer. </p>
      <p>Selected photographs from this collection have been exhibited at the Center for Documentary
        Studies at Duke and other locations. A selection of Rankin's photographs was published in a
        book, <title render="italic">Sacred Space: Photographs from the Mississippi Delta</title>
        (1993).</p>
      <p>Supporting materials in this collection include a digital audio recording of a talk by
        Rankin at the exhibit opening of work from the Sacred Space series, "Near the Cross:
        Photographs from the Mississippi Delta," as well as paper records related to his career and
        art practice, including book publications and book layouts. Also in the collection are two
        motion films, <title render="italic">Dance Like a River</title> (1985), directed by Barry
        Dorfeld and Tom Rankin, and <title render="italic">Four Women Artists</title> (1977),
        directed by Bill Ferris.</p>

          <p>This body of work comprises 62 black-and-white prints that document and reflect on
            spiritual and religious practices in the rural Mississippi Delta region of the Southern
            United States, with a focus on churches, pastors and congregations, cemetery sites, and
            baptisms. Selected images were published in "Sacred Space: Photographs from the
            Mississippi Delta," and exhibited in 2008 at Duke University as "Near the Cross:
            Photographs from the Mississippi Delta."</p>
          <p>The artist offers his reflection on the project: "No single institution in the Delta
            region has had a more profound impact on the entire culture of the Mississippi Delta
            than the countless African-American churches that accent the landscape. The ubiquitous
            presence of these churches and their adjoining cemeteries and churchyards - these sacred
            spaces - constitutes a kind of three-dimensional iconography in an otherwise profane
            agricultural landscape. Landmarks to some, places of spiritual refuge to others, 'home
            church' to their devoted members, these centers of religious and social life have been
            planned, built, decorated, and maintained by local communities for heartfelt
            reasons...Thus the look and life of the church, inside and out, reflect the attitudes,
            beliefs, aspirations, and realities of the community...The church survives not only as a
            place of worship, but also as a symbol to the membership of a sacred home where a formal
            commitment to religion began, where family meets, and where forebears once
            gathered."</p>
          <p>The prints in this series come in many sizes and processes: 11x14 inch unmatted
            black-and-white gelatin silver prints (box 2); 11x14 gelatin silver prints in 16x20 inch
            mats (box 7); 16x20 inch unmatted prints (boxes 4-5); and 16x20 inch gelatin silver
            prints in 20x24 inch mats (box 6). Prints in Box 3 are 8 1/2 x 11 contact prints, with
            slight variations, in 11x14 inch window mats; there are a few prints in this group that
            have larger finished print versions in the collection. Within size categories, prints
            are arranged in order as assigned by the photographer. All titles are original. </p>

          <p>These black-and-white gelatin silver photographs were taken by Tom Rankin while in
            Kunshan, China in 2016 and printed by Rankin in 2018. Sizes of prints range from 11x14
            (9), 16x20 (18), and 20x24 inches (3). Scenes include rural landscapes surrounding the
            Duke University Kunshan campus; canals and barges; a fish market; vegetable gardens
            tended by lone figures, often in the shadow of industrial structures; an abandoned theme
            park; and religious shrines.</p>
