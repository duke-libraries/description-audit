      <p>Jerome Paul Stirewalt, one of Jacob Stirewalt's four sons, studied theology under pastors
        of the Tennessee Synod. During his career as a pastor, which spanned from 1874 to 1920, he
        served fourteen different churches in pastorates in Virginia. Jerome Paul Stirewalt was very
        active in the leadership of the Tennessee Synod, serving as secretary for six terms, and
        four terms each as treasurer and president. He was a frequent contributor to Lutheran and
        secular periodicals and contributed an article on the history of the Tennessee Synod for
        "The Lutherans in America," edited by E.J. Wolf.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Stirewalt Family Papers, 1828-1993 (bulk 1850-1947), are comprised of the personal
        papers of individuals from four successive generations of the Stirewalt family. The
        correspondence, writings, diaries, legal/financial documents, photographs, and other
        miscellaneous papers found in this collection document the Stirewalt Family's personal lives
        and involvement in the Lutheran Church as ministers, educators and missionaries. The
        collection is divided into four primary series which reflect the individuals whose papers
        make up this collection: Jacob Stirewalt, Jerome Paul Stirewalt, Martin Luther Stirewalt,
        and Catherine A. Stirewalt. The arrangement of the collection is primarily chronological,
        following the lineage of the Stirewalt family. Subsections within each major series are
        determined by the type of materials found within the collection and are arranged either
        chronologically, as in the case of the Diaries and Correspondence Subseries, or
        alphabetically and thereunder chronologically, as in the case of the Writings Subseries.</p>
      <p>The Stirewalt family is descended from Jacob Stirewalt, a minister and member of the
        Tennessee Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. Jacob Stirewalt was primarily active in
        and around New Market, Va. and Rowan and Shenandoah counties in Virginia. The Subseries
        related to Jacob Stirewalt includes Correspondence from 1828-1858, Writings (primarily
        sermons and sermon outlines in German and English) from the 1830s to the 1860s, and Diaries,
        which includes a Memorandum book where he recorded financial transactions and other records
        of his career as a minister from 1834 to his death in 1869.</p>
      <p>Jerome Paul Stirewalt, the son of Jacob Stirewalt, was also a minister and a leader of the
        Tennessee Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. He served as a minister in several
        pastorates in Virginia and North Carolina and several terms as president, secretary, and
        treasurer of the Tennessee Synod in the late 1800s and early 1900s. His papers are primarily
        composed of Correspondence, 1870-1933, with other ministers, relating to the business of the
        Tennessee Synod, and with family members. The collection also includes Jerome Paul
        Stirewalt's Writings, primarily sermons and sermon outlines, and other miscellaneous
        financial and legal papers. The Diaries Subseries is primarily memorandum books which list
        the date and location of religious services performed and the topic or title of sermons
        delivered by J.P. Stirewalt. These books serve to provide a record of Stirewalt's work as a
        Lutheran minister.</p>
      <p>Martin Luther Stirewalt, the son of Jerome Paul Stirewalt, was also a Lutheran minister and
        educator at Lutheran schools and colleges in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and
        Chicago, Ill. This series includes correspondence, diaries, writings and clippings which
        provide a picture of Stirewalt's theological education, activities as a minister and
        educator, and insights into his personal life and familial relationships. </p>
      <p>The papers of Catherine A Stirewalt, Martin Luther Stirewalt's daughter, are primarily
        correspondence written while she was a Lutheran Missionary in China from 1939-1949. This
        correspondence provides documentation of the Lutheran Church's activities in China prior to
        and after World War II. Catherine Stirewalt's letters provide a great deal of detail about
        the daily lives of missionaries in China and some information about the lives of the Chinese
        people working as instructors or attending the mission school. There is no correspondence
        from the period of the first two years of World War II when she was interned in the Weihsien
        concentration camp near Tsingtao, China. Other miscellaneous clippings, photographs, and
        writings in this series provide further documentation of her experiences in China.</p>

              <p>Stirewalt's sermons are primarily in English, but several of his early sermons are
                in German. Many of the sermons exist only as detailed outlines, which may have been
                used as notes to be referred to when delivering the sermon. The sermons are arranged
                chronologically, with undated sermons, fragments, and notes grouped at the end of

            <p>The chronologically arranged Writings Subseries primarily consists of sermons and
              sermon outlines, the bulk of which appear to be outlines which Stirewalt used as
              references while delivering the sermons. Most of the sermons are dated and the
              location where each was written, primarily New Market, Va., is given. The outlines are
              very detailed, providing titles, and references to biblical texts cited by the sermon
              or used as evidence to support the theme of the sermon. Three folders of undated
              sermons are filed at the end of this subseries.</p>

            <p>The Writings Subseries is arranged in loosely chronological order and consists of
              Martin Luther Stirewalt's early religious and professional writings. The subseries is
              composed of notebooks containing coursework and religious essays written while a
              student at the Chicago Lutheran Theological Seminary, later student essays, sermons
              and speeches, and notes and drafts for other religious and professional writings. Many
              of the sermons included in this subseries appear to have been developed and compiled
              by Stirewalt as guides to sermon writing and were possibly used as curriculums for
              courses he taught.</p>

            <p>The chronologically arranged Correspondence Subseries consists of letters written by
              Catherine Stirewalt to her family and friends during her time spent working and
              studying in China. In her letters she discusses her day to day life in China, the
              progress of her studies of the Chinese language, and the details of sightseeing trips
              made near Tsingtao, China. The letters begin in<unitdate era="ce" calendar="gregorian"
                type="inclusive">1939,</unitdate>just prior to her departure for China, and continue
              on a weekly basis through December of<unitdate era="ce" calendar="gregorian"
                type="inclusive">1941</unitdate>and the beginning of World War II. Her

              notes written during the difficult five-week sea journey that she made on her return
              to the United States. The letters from her second stay in China provide a detailed
              picture of the difficult living conditions for the Chinese people following WWII. She
              discusses how inflation and scarcity of food and other supplies affected the region of
              China where she had been working. She also discusses the difficult living conditions
              of the missionaries and the problems they had performing their work. Her letters
                in<unitdate era="ce" calendar="gregorian" type="inclusive">1949</unitdate>discuss
              the political situation in China, her struggles with making a decision to stay in
              China, and the day to day lives of the missionaries with whom she is working. There is
              a gap in correspondence from May of<unitdate era="ce" calendar="gregorian"
