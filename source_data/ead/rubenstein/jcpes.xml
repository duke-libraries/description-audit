      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>The Joint Center for Political Studies and Economic Studies (JCPES) is a 501(c)(3)
        non-profit organization based in Washington, DC that creates policy and programs that
        improve the socioeconomic status and civic engagement of African Americans. The think tank
        was founded in 1970 as the Joint Center for Political Studies (JCPS) to aid black elected
        officials create effective policy and successfully serve their constituents. Founders
        included the social psychologist Dr. Kenneth B. Clark, and newspaper editor Louis E. Martin.
        The organization later became the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies (JCPES)
        1990.</p>
      <p>Joint Center scholars, researchers and analysts studies, conducted projects, and programmed
        forums and conferences covering increased political participation, job creation, workforce
        development, and health care strategies. Each of the events produced booklets, reports and
        booklets of use to government officials and the general public. These conversations included
        the Congressional Black Caucus, African American mayors, and state and local legislators.
        Interactions with presidential cabinet members, journalists, and foreign policy ambassadors
        represented the full spectrum of the American political system.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The collection is comprised of administrative records for the Joint Center for Political
        and Economic Studies, and includes correspondence, memoranda, budgets, funding reports,
        publications, policy research studies, conference materials, photographs, audiovisual media,
        and electronic records. Areas of study include healthcare, HIV/AIDS, minority business,
        television violence, young fathers, education, and minority community representation. </p>
      <p>Among its many publications, JCPES published FOCUS magazine from 1972 to 2011, which
        covered national issues for an audience largely comprised of black elected officials (BEOs).
        The collection also includes oral histories of Joint Center founders and influencers,
        interview transcripts, an extensive history of JCPES, materials from the The Joint Center
        South Africa office which provided post-Apartheid political assistance activities, and
        original Southern Regional Council publications.</p>
      <p>Other materials include interviews/oral histories with founders Louis Martin, educator
        Kenneth B. Clark who was the first African American president of the American Psychological
        Association; and McGeorge Bundy, who served as United States National Security Advisor to
        Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson on foreign and defense policy from 1961
        through 1966. Interviews and transcripts that add historical perspective to African American
        issues are conversations with Southern black mayors; African American architect and social
        activist Carl Anthony; and Ernest Green, one of the Little Rock Nine. </p>
      <p>Conferences included forums, roundtables, and speeches from notable figures, elected
        officials, and congressional members including Maya Angelou, Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Edward
        Brooke, Ron Brown, Carol Moseley Braun, George H.W. Bush, Barbara Bush, Henry Cisneros,
        Shirley Chisholm, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Charles Diggs, John Hope Franklin, Jesse
        Jackson, Maynard Jackson, Valerie Jarrett, Barbara Jordan, Vernon Jordan, Jack Kemp, Coretta
        Scott King, John Lewis, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Barack Obama, Colin Powell, Charles Rangel,
        Ronald Reagan, Kasim Reed, Condoleezza Rice, Susan Rice, Donna Shalala, Rodney Slater, Doug
        Wilder, and Andrew Young. Joint Center historical notes compiled by Darlene Clark Hine are
        included, as well as Juan Williams' historical publication The Joint Center: Portrait of a
        Black Think Tank. The files and speeches of Joint Center past presidents Eddie N. Williams;
        Togo West, Jr.; Ralph Everett, Esq.; and past vice president Eleanor Farrar add insight to
        the Joint Center's mission of illuminating concerns and trends affecting 20th century
        African Americans to the legislative influencers most able to effect change.</p>

          <p>Included in the Center Leadership and Administrative series are administrative records
            in the form of progress and other reports, accounting files, correspondence, historic
            documents, minutes, by-laws, member biographies, photographs, and audiovisual media.
            They follow the Joint Center original arrangement, which may be chronological and/or
            alphabetical. The series is divided into two subseries: Board of Governors (BOG), and
            Office of the President (OOP). The BOG files relate to board activities, namely the
            annual dinner and meeting, that date back to the organization's founding in the late
            1960s. The OOP files are divided into the offices of Eddie N. Williams, Togo D. West,
            and Ralph B. Everett, with each having their respective correspondence, speeches, and
            subject files. The Presidents' subject files were created by the OOP and include files
            for each of the three presidents represented in this collection.</p>

            <p>The Joint Center's Office of Information Resources/Library functioned as the
              organization's resource center and archive, and the subseries includes subject files
              comprised of Joint Center published and unpublished essays, conference proceedings,
              studies, and research on policy issues of concern to African American communities.
              This subseries also includes print materials that range from short pamphlets to books.
              Most of the materials were printed by the Joint Center. Other materials not printed by
              the Joint Center include reference books that were used to write reports and
              pamphlets. Print materials are arranged by topic and include health, voting,
              education, economics, policy, and Joint Center information. The Joint Center's main
              publications, Black Elected Officials: A National Roster, and FOCUS magazine, can be
              found here.The materials did not have a discernible original order and have been
              grouped by topic and arranged chronologically.</p>

                <p>In 1993 the Joint Center's Office of International Affairs opened an office in
                  Johannesburg, South Africa, to provide political assistance activities and
                  legislative training to new post-Apartheid political parties. Research studies and
                  projects focused on voter education and governance, youth HIV/AIDS programs in
                  partnership with Schools Health and Population Education (SHAPE), and women's
                  empowerment. Prior to the opening of the office, the Joint Center conducted
                  economic, governance, and voting forums and summits. Materials are arranged
                  chronologically.</p>

                  from the Southern Regional Council, an organization founded in 1944 to avoid

                  Joint Center used the Southern Regional Council's voter registration and

                <p>In 1981 and 1982, the Joint Center, Kenneth B. Clark, and John Hope Franklin
                  assembled twenty-five scholars and policy leaders to discuss their publication,
                  The Nineteen Eighties: Prologue and Prospect. The Committee for Policy on Racial
                  Justice proceedings held in Tarrytown, New York yielded wide-ranging discussions
                  about the effects of racism on African American families especially concerning the
                  economy and education. The materials containing transcripts, correspondence, and
                  reports, are arranged chronologically.</p>

            <p>The National Policy Institute (NPI) was held every four years at the beginning each
              presidential election year for groups representing black public officials from
              federal, state and local government organizations to present policy and work on issues
              of importance to African American communities. Later NPI became an independent program
              named the National Policy Alliance. This subseries includes programs, essays, special
              reports, fact sheets, financial reports, memorandums, correspondence, financial
              summaries, proposals, mailings, personnel rosters, steering committee documents,
              registration information, newsletters, budgets, projects, event planning materials,
              research, articles, surveys, agendas, lists of program participants, and photographs
              related to the event. The materials are arranged chronologically.</p>

            <p>The mission of the Civic Engagement and Governance Institute (CEGI) was to understand
              how people of color perceive the world and to increase their participation in
              democratic institutions. To meet this goal, CEGI issued publications and sponsored
              events where topics included children's and adolescent health, HIV/AIDS, African
              Americans and climate change, Social Security, Medicaid, Latino reproductive health,
              and various community-based projects. Major funders included the Ford Foundation and
              the Annie E. Casey Foundation. This subseries is arranged chronologically.</p>

          <p>The original computer disks acquired with the records of the Joint Center for Political
            and Economic Studies (JCPES) contain files of many types, chiefly software programs,
            memos, correspondence, events materials, analytical summaries of panels and meetings on
            a wide variety of social issues, and administrative materials such as budgets. These
            files have been migrated to a library server. The three video files all relate to the
            JCPES annual Gala Dinner event in 2013; for ease of access, .mp4 video files have been
            made available as use copies; access to original .mov files is availalable upon
            request.</p>
