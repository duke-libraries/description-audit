      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Launched by Duke University's Lyndhurst Center for Documentary Studies in 1990, the Behind
        the Veil project seeks to record and preserve the living memory of African-American life
        during the age of legal segregation in the American South, from the 1890s to the 1950s. In
        order to correct historical misrepresentations of African-American experiences in the Jim
        Crow South, the project seized the opportunity to capture, through interviews, family
        photographs and other materials, the memories of black elders who survived this era of
        profound racial oppression. The resulting collection offers researchers an abundance of rich
        resources for understanding black self-images, racial pride and achievement during the long
        period of American apartheid. This documentary record reflects not only the terror, hardship
        and frustration of this period of second-class citizenship, but also the individual and
        collective struggles of black southerners to survive and prosper in spite of the policies of
        white supremacy. By collecting narratives that recount the everyday experiences of African
        Americans from various locations and backgrounds, the collection provides rich documentary
        evidence of the diversity of black life during the Jim Crow era.</p>
      <p>Behind the Veil not only focuses on the experiences of individuals, but it also reflects
        the importance of black institutions as the backbone of black communities. The interviews,
        documents and photographs reflect the crucial role that black churches, fraternal societies,
        women's clubs, and political organizations played in African American community life. The
        testimony of educators and students from historically black colleges, agricultural schools
        and institutes enrich conventional beliefs about black agency in segregated schools. A rich
        record about black education can be gleaned from examining certain research sites including
        Tuskegee, Ala.; Fargo, Ark.; Tallahassee, Fla.; and Norfolk, Va.</p>
      <p>Behind the Veil also provides a richly detailed account of the shape of southern
        segregation across time and in diverse locations, mapping the contours of both the formal
        laws and informal rules that restricted southern life. Segregation as public policy differed
        in rural and urban communities, while the rules that governed black interactions with whites
        often were distinct to each community. These nuances that governed race relations in
        southern cities, towns and rural communities are interspersed throughout the documents in
        this collection.</p>
      <p>Although the questions that spurred on research in the Behind the Veil Project were raised
        by historians interested primarily in the age of segregation, the resulting record can
        inform research in diverse fields. Although the focus of the interviews was on the Jim Crow
        era, the life history format of most interviews led informants to comment on events after
        segregation. Vital information about civil rights struggles in the 1960s, African American
        participation in desegregation within local communities, and post-1965 activism and
        community work are also included in many Behind the Veil interviews. The interviews in this
        collection also raise crucial questions about the shape of memory and the creation of
        narratives that can inform not only research in oral history but also literature and
        anthropology. Research into black religion can be enriched by the voices of Behind the Veil.
        Studies that examine oppression and resistance could be challenged by the rich documentary
        record of labor and social culture that the collection presents. The Behind the Veil
        collection illuminates innumerable topics, time periods, and research interests.</p>
      <p>During the summers of 1993, 1994 and 1995, multi-racial research teams traveled throughout
        the South to conduct oral history interviews with elders in African-American communities.
        During the first summer, the project ran a series of pilot studies in five North Carolina
        communities. Subsequently, the project followed a thematic approach while conducting
        research in areas selected to represent the diversity of cultures and geographic regions
        within the South, as well as the predominant work cultures of the region. Researchers were
        chosen from applications from history graduate students at a diverse range of schools, from
        the Ivy League to historically black institutions such as Jackson State and Clark-Atlanta to
        state universities such as Michigan and Maryland. Collectively, they conducted 1260 oral
        history interviews in more than twenty communities in ten Southern states. They also copied
        thousands of family photographs and other materials that reveal the diversity of
        African-American experiences under Jim Crow.</p>
      <p>While based at Duke University, the Behind the Veil project has been a collaborative
        venture from its inception. Scholars from historically black colleges and universities such
        as LeMoyne-Owen College, North Carolina Central University, Johnson C. Smith University,
        Jackson State University and Clark-Atlanta University have helped to shape the research
        project and have developed related curriculum projects to introduce undergraduates to oral
        history methodology as a means to discover and document the histories of the communities in
        which they live. Research teams worked in collaboration with a wide variety of black
        community and civic groups, which played critical roles in recruiting potential interviewees
        and providing logistical support. Summer researchers were hosted by distinguished
        institutions such as the Black Archives at Florida A&amp;M University and the Civil Rights
        Institute in Birmingham, Alabama. Local institutions also helped researchers to understand
        the communities in which they worked and to frame their interview questions and research
        agendas accordingly. In turn, the Behind the Veil project has deposited copies of the
        interviews in local archives at or near the various cooperating institutions, assuring that
        these histories will be accessible to local community members as well as scholars throughout
        the South.</p>
      <p>The Behind the Veil project received major funding from the National Endowment for the
        Humanities, the Ford Foundation and the Lyndhurst Foundation. Duke University historians
        William Chafe, Raymond Gavins and Robert Korstad co-direct the project. Aminah Pilgrim has
        served as Research Associate for Behind the Veil, and Leslie Brown, Alexander X. Byrd, Greta
        Ai-Yu Niu, Paul Ortiz and Anne M. Valk have been the project's Research Coordinators.</p>
      <p>The addition to the collection, 2000-0183, includes information from <emph

        associated with the Behind the Veil oral history project at Duke's Center for Documentary

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Behind the Veil: Documenting African-American Life in the Jim Crow South Records span
        the years 1940-1997 (bulk 1993-1997) and are comprised chiefly of interviews recorded on
        cassette tapes. The 1260 interviews, 1993-1997, in this collection cover a number of topics
        related to African-American life in the 20th century with a focus on the age of southern
        segregation. The collection includes interviews with people from Albany, Ga.; Fargo, Ark.;
        Birmingham and Tuskegee, Ala.; Charlotte, Durham, Enfield, New Bern and Wilmington, N. C.;
        LeFlore County, Miss.; Memphis, Tenn.; Muhlenburg County, Ky.; New Iberia and New Orleans,
        La.; Norfolk, Va.; Columbia, Orangeburg, St. Helena, and Summerton, S. C.; and Tallahassee,
        Fla. In addition to interviews conducted specifically for the Behind the Veil project, the
        collection includes six interviews from the James City Historical Society, Craven County,
        N.C. as well as eight interviews conducted by Paul Ortiz in Tallahassee, Fla., in the summer
        of 1997 as part of his dissertation research.</p>
      <p>The collection includes duplicate sets of approximately 1700 interview tapes. The Master
        Tapes Series is closed except for appropriate use by authorized staff from the Behind the
        Veil project and the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library. The Use Tapes
        Series contains copies of the tapes for use by researchers. The Printed Materials Series
        provides biographical information about informants, interview agreement forms, proper names
        sheets, and brief summaries (one-three pages) of each of the 1260 interviews. Also included
        are some personal papers, the earliest of which is dated 1940. The Transcripts Series
        currently includes unverified transcripts of 314 interviews in the collection. These
        transcripts are also available as electronic documents. A disk directory log exists. Contact
        Research Services staff for more information. More transcripts will be available each
        semester.</p>
      <p>The Behind the Veil collection will eventually include approximately 5100 photographs and
        slides. This Visual Materials Series will contain items donated by informants and others in
        the communities where Behind the Veil field-workers conducted interviews. The vast majority
        of these pictures show family and community members at home or at special events. A smaller
        number portray buildings and other local places. Images of political events are notably rare
        in the collection. We also anticipate the eventual addition of the Behind the Veil project's
        papers, which will be held as the Administrative Files Series.</p>
      <p>Behind the Veil interviewers were provided with a list of Interview Questions before they
        entered the field. Although most interviews in the collection do not follow the list
        question by question, the list provides a useful research guide to the type of inquiry many
        interviews follow. The list of questions is included as an appendix in this guide.
        Frequently discussed topics include family history, local neighborhoods, educational
        background, employment history, religious institutions, experiences of segregation, local
        political activities, civic organizations and activities, black-owned businesses and local
        culture. Behind the Veil informants represent a number of occupational groups, including
        domestic workers, educators, homemakers, health professionals, manufacturing workers,
        miners, ministers, political figures, professionals and servicemen.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Database:</emph>
      </p>
      <p>A Behind the Veil Database, created by Alex X. Byrd, will soon accompany the collection.
        The fields included are in two categories: Informant and Circumstance of Interview. The
        Informant fields are Last Name, First Name, Middle or Maiden Name, Sex, Zip Code, Date of
        Birth, Place of Birth, and Principal Occupations. The Circumstance of Interview fields are
        Date of Interview, Location of Interview, Processing Subseries, and Interviewers. The other
        fields are: was the informant part of a group interview?; has the interview been
        transcribed?; if part of a group interview, under whose name is the material filed?; number
        of tapes for interview.</p>
      <p>Consult reference staff concerning the availability of the database.</p>
      <p>The addition (acc# 2001-0183)(100 items, 1.5 linear feet; dated 1996-1997) includes a
        course syllabus, interviews of African-American North Carolinians on cassette tapes, some
        student self-evaluations, contracts, indices, and transcript excerpts. The area most
        represented is Durham, N.C. Students were to aim for insight into how African-Americans
        built communities during an age of racial oppression. The interviews include much
        information about family history and social and community issues.</p>

        requesting specific materials. For example, if you wish to use the third box of use tapes,
        request box UT3. Complete details about the arrangement of each series can be found below in

          <p>The Printed Materials Series, <unitdate era="ce" calendar="gregorian" type="inclusive"
              >ca. 1940-1997</unitdate>(bulk <unitdate era="ce" calendar="gregorian"
              type="inclusive">1993-1997</unitdate>), contains all the official paperwork related to
            the 1260 recorded interviews found in the Use Tapes Series. Researchers will be
            particularly interested in the interview summary forms, which provide an overview of
            topics covered in each interview, and the biographical information and family history
            forms, which offer a quick sketch of each informant's' life history. For detailed
            information about any restrictions that may apply to the use of information in a
            particular interview, patrons are directed to consult the interview agreements and
            photograph agreements found in these files. In some cases, interviewees have completed
            proper name forms to assist researchers in properly identifying names mentioned during
            an interview. Additionally, the series contains personal papers contributed by some
            informants, including newspaper clippings, personal photographs, programs from local
            events, and other memorabilia. These personal papers, the earliest of which is dated
              <unitdate era="ce" calendar="gregorian" type="inclusive">1940, </unitdate>are filed in
            the printed materials folder under each donor's name.</p>

          <p>Most of the materials in this series are unrestricted. However, in cases in which
            restrictions apply to the use of printed materials -- i.e., the materials are available
            to researchers but with some restrictions on their use -- the appropriate folders have
            been stamped with a red <emph render="doublequote">restrictions</emph> warning. The
            relevant interview and/or photographs agreements, detailing the specific restrictions on
            those materials, have been placed at the front of each of these files so patrons may
            readily familiarize themselves with these conditions before proceeding with research.
            Other access restricted materials, which are closed to researchers, are housed
            separately at the end of this series.</p>

              >1993-1997, </unitdate> includes transcripts of 314 interviews in the Behind the Veil
            collection. Interviews were chosen for transcription on the basis of the quality and
            content of particular interviews, and toward the goal of providing transcripts that
            cover the geographical and topical range of the collection. They are arranged
            alphabetically by site and by surname within. The transcripts also exist as electronic
            documents. A disk directories log exists. Contact Research Services staff for
            assistance.</p>
