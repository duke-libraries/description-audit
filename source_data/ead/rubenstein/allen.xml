         <p>The Gay Wilson Allen Papers span the years 1801 to 1988, but the bulk of the collection
            occurs during the years 1925 to the 1970s. They consist of correspondence, notebooks,
            printed material, essays and other writings, literary manuscripts, scrapbooks, teaching
            materials, pictures, books, clippings, offprints, periodicals, and sale catalogs. The
            focus of the collection is Allen's career as a university professor and Walt Whitman
            scholar. In particular Allen's activities as a professor at New York University and as a
            lecturer at Nagono, Japan in 1955, are documented. The history of Whitman criticism is
            an important theme. There is a large amount of research material on Whitman, both of

         <p>Allen's career, both as a professor and Whitman scholar, is documented in several
            series. The Walt Whitman Materials Series and the Scrapbooks Series relate to his
            Whitman research. In the former series the Commemorations and Societies Subseries and
            the Popular Culture Subseries also document the ever increasing interest in Whitman's
            life and works during the twentieth century. The Correspondence Subseries and the
            Pictures Subseries contain copies of letters and pictures relating to Whitman and his
            age. The Correspondence Series also contains extensive letters concerning Allen's early
            teaching career, his dealings with several presses, and the marketing and reception of
            his <title type="simple" render="italic"> The Solitary Singer, a Whitman
               biography.</title>
         </p>
         <p>The papers of six Whitman scholars are in the Walt Whitman Scholars Series. It suggests
            the international range both of Whitman scholarship and of Allen's interests. In
            addition to the interest in Whitman she shared with her husband, Evie Allison Allen was
            also a skilled translator of Germanic languages. Charles N. Elliot and Emory Holloway,
            as well as Canadian Henry Scholey Saunders, were Whitman collector-scholars who
            interacted with both Allen and Furness. The late Peter Mitilineos was one of Allen's
            students and was particularly interested in the writings of Italian Whitman scholar
            Pasquale Jannacone. Professor and Mrs. Allen both had an interest in the writings of
            German Whitman scholar Hans Reisiger.</p>
         <p>The Clifton Joseph Furness Papers Series documents the history of Whitman criticism from
            Whitman's day to the start of Allen's biography of Whitman, <title type="simple"
               render="italic">The Solitary Singer.</title> Allen used some of Furness's research
            materials to write the book. The Clara Barrus Papers Subseries contains her research
            materials on the relationship between Whitman and John Burroughs. In fact Barrus was a
            close friend of Whitman's friends Burroughs and Thomas Biggs Harned. The subseries
            includes portions of Barrus's correspondence, her research materials, and the manuscript
            of her study of Whitman and Burroughs, entitled <title type="simple" render="italic"
               >Whitman and Burroughs, Comrades.</title> The Correspondence Subseries contains
            correspondence with a number of Whitman friends, scholars, and collectors. The Writings
            Subseries chiefly reflects the results of the information Furness collected on Whitman
            during the 1930s and 1940s. Furness began three major Whitman projects: a definitive
            biography, an extensive bibliography, and a study of his reception in New England,
            tentatively entitled <title type="simple" render="doublequote">The Bull in the China
               Shop.</title> None of these works were published during Furness's lifetime.</p>

            <emph render="bold">Provenance Note on the Clifton Joseph Furness Papers Series</emph>
         </p>
         <p>Gay Wilson Allen acquired Clifton Joseph Furness's papers in 1948, but Furness had
            acquired some of Clara Barrus's papers shortly before her death in 1931. In turn Barrus,
            in her role as the literary executor of John Burroughs, had acquired some of Burroughs's
            papers in the years before his death in 1921. Apparently, Barrus had originally planned
            to write an extensive study of Whitman and his followers, based on materials found in
            her Research Files, but she apparently later decided to narrow its focus to a study of
            the relationship between Whitman and Burroughs. During Burroughs's last years she
            retyped some of his correspondence with Whitman and related figures, and in her own hand
            transcribed Burroughs's comments on each letter. With the help of Furness, Barrus
            published her last book, <title type="simple" render="italic">Whitman and Burroughs,
               Comrades</title> in 1931. About that time, Furness acquired the materials found in
            the Clara Barrus Papers Subseries.</p>
         <p>Furness was in close contact with other Whitman friends, scholars, and collectors, and
            spent years collecting information on Whitman. None of these projects were published
            during his lifetime.</p>
         <p>In 1948, New York University professor Gay Wilson Allen was able to persuade the
            university to purchase for his use Furness's papers, which by now included papers from
            Barrus and Burroughs as well. David Goodale and Henry Scholey Saunders agreed to
            cooperate with Allen in the publication of Furness's Whitman bibliography. In about l951
            Allen acquired Saunders's revised copy of the portion of Furness's Whitman bibliography
            concerned with <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Biography and
               Criticism,</title> Part 6 (of 11). After Furness's death Allen, with the help of some
            of the Furness Papers, wrote a Whitman biography, which eventually became <title
