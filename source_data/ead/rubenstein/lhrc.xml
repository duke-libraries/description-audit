         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The LHRC was a nonprofit organization founded in 1996 to provide educational workshops
            and resource materials on all health issues for women who partner with women. It was the
            successor organization to the North Carolina Lesbian and Gay Health Project, whose
            records the Sallie Bingham Center also holds. The NCLGHP was founded in 1982 to combat
            homophobia in existing health care institutions, and to provide gay men and lesbians the
            means to assume control over their own health care.</p>

      <scopecontent id="aspace_7e33011931e2c17f5840e15eed1f9cb6">
         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The records of the LHRC are in many was a continuation of the records from the North
            Carolina Lesbian and Gay Health Project, also held by the Bingham Center. Early
            materials frequently reference or were created by NCLGHP members, and there are also
            overlapping interests with some resources for gay men, despite the fact that the
            majority of the materials are targeted towards the lesbian community and their
            activities in the Triangle.</p>
         <p>The grant materials and other financial files that make up the first series include
            applications, correspondence, and general information about the budget of the LHRC and
            the grants that it sought for programs and operations. Also included in this series are
            materials from the 501(c)3 application, as well as some correspondence from the IRS
            regarding the organization's tax status. </p>
         <p>The LHRC's Lesbian Health Clinic files detail the planning and fundraising by the
            organization in preparation for opening the LHC. This series includes correspondence,
            steering committee minutes, handouts from different fundraising and awareness events,
            and other notes and research about healthcare and the operation of a health clinic. </p>
         <p>The collection's subject files are largely drawn from the LHRC Resource Library, which
            was maintained by the LHRC for use by its members. Topics include healthcare,
            particularly women's health and lesbian health; cancer, especially breast cancer; AIDS
            and the spread of HIV; safe sex; domestic violence; parenting; homophobia, especially
            within the medical community; and other topics like health reading materials or other
            resources. </p>
         <p>Some of the LHRC's activities and events are documented in the fourth series, including
            information and planning materials from the NCGLHP's participation in the Breast Cancer
            Leadership Summit and subsequent breast cancer awareness events in the early 1990s.
            Other activities represented include North Carolina Pride Days, breastcasting, a lesbian
            sex group, and general healthcare workshops. </p>
         <p>Finally, the administrative files relate to the running of the LHRC, including
            everything from document masters for letterhead and logos to the volunteer orientation
            materials from orientations as late as 2005. Also includes some information from partner
            organizations, including the Mautner Project, Lesbian Avengers, and local community
            organizations including Triange Community Works. Related to this series is the Oversize
            Materials series, which consists of two document masters for posters promoting awareness
            about breast cancer and AIDS in the lesbian community.</p>
         <p>The Restricted series is actually just one box of material, mainly membership and
            participation lists, which is closed until 2030. </p>
         <p>Acquired as part of the Sallie Bingham Center for Women's History and Culture.</p>
