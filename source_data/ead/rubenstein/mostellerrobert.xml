         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>Robert P. Mosteller (b. 1948) is the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Professor
            of Law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He was born in North Carolina
            and earned graduate degrees from both Yale and Harvard before working for the
            Washington, D.C. Public Defender Service as Director of Training and Chief of the Trial
            Division. Mosteller taught at Duke Law School from 1983 to 2008. He is particularly
            interested the death penalty, and served as co-reported for the Death Penalty Initiative
            of the Constitution Project and as president of the North Carolina Center for Death
            Penalty Litigation.</p>
         <p>Mosteller was also an attorney for John Wesley Oliver, a former death row inmate whose
            case file represents the content in this collection.</p>
         <p>In May 1979, John Wesley Oliver and co-defendant George Moore, Jr., were convicted of
            murdering Allen Watts and Dayton Hodge in an armed robbery of a gas station in Robeson
            County, North Carolina. Oliver was sentenced to death for both murders, while Moore was
            sentenced to death for the murder of Dayton Hodge. On appeal, the Supreme Court of North
            Carolina affirmed the defendants' convictions, but vacated the death sentences and
            remanded the cases for re-sentencing. </p>
         <p>In January 1982, Oliver was re-sentenced to death for the murder of Dayton Hodge, and
            both defendants were sentenced to death for the murder of Allen Watts. The case was
            appealed, and the death penalty for Watts' murder was overturned, but Oliver's second
            death sentence for the murder of Dayton Hodge was affirmed.</p>
         <p>In April 1994, following a hearing on Oliver's Motion for Appropriate Relief, the court
            vacated Oliver's death sentence when the Superior Court judge found that the prosecution
            had withheld from the defense important information that would have cast doubt on
            eyewitnesses' identification of Oliver as the person responsible for the death of Dayton
            Hodge. The judge ordered a new sentencing hearing regarding Hodge's murder. In a 2009
            article, Mosteller writes that "a combination of processes resulted in the exclusion of
            all African Americans in a jurisdiction where approximately one-fourth of the population
            was African American from a jury that in 1982 recommended death sentences for two
            African American defendents [Oliver and Moore] charged with the murder of two white
            men.... The death sentence was vacated on the basis of a violation of the defendant's
            due process rights under <title type="simple" render="italic">Brady v. Maryland</title>"
            (Kotch and Mosteller: "The Racial Justice Act and the Long Struggle with Race and the
            Death Penalty in North Carolina"). </p>
         <p>The cases came before the court in November 2001 for re-sentencing, and the State of
            North Carolina elected not to seek the death penalty. Oliver was sentenced to life
            imprisonment for both murders, while Moore was sentenced to life imprisonment for the
            murder of Dayton Hodge. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Collection consists of the case file for John Wesley Oliver, a former death row inmate
            who was represented by Robert P. Mosteller. Materials from Oliver's case (as well as his
            co-defendant, George Moore, Jr.) date as early as witness statements from 1978, and end
            with NC Court of Appeals judgments from 2002. The majority of the files are legal
            motions, trial transcripts, and court orders from Moore and Oliver's various court cases
            and appeals in 1979, 1982, 1993, and 2001. There is very little material that falls
            outside the official documentation of the case, and there is no personal material from
            Mosteller in this collection. Files have been arranged as best as possible in
            chronological order. </p>
