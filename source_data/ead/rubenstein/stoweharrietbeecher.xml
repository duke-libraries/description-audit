        attests to Truth's character. She then mentions that the sales of the work will "secure a

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Harriet Elisabeth Beecher Stowe (1811 June 14-1896 July 1) was an American abolitionist and
        author. Her novel Uncle Tom's Cabin(1852) was a depiction of life for African Americans
        under slavery; it reached millions as a novel and play, and became influential in the United
        States and United Kingdom. It energized anti-slavery forces in the American North, while
        provoking widespread anger in the South. She wrote more than 20 books, including novels,
        three travel memoirs, and collections of articles and letters. She was influential for both
        her writings and her public stands on social issues of the day.</p>
