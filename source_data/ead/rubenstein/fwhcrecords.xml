      <abstract id="aspace_b80126141e5e4245623f1baf8ad7574c">The Feminist Women's Health Center in
        Atlanta, Georgia, was founded in 1976 by a group of women dissatisfied with the health care
        options and information available to them and who desired to change this situation. The
        clinic started in 1977 with self-help groups where women were able to learn from each other
        and themselves through open discussions. It expanded to offer a full range of clinical
        services (including providing access to birth control and contraception, abortion, donor
        insemination, and pregnancy care) as well as educational, outreach, and advocacy programs,
        addressing subjects such as sexual hygiene, sex, and sexually transmitted diseases.
        Collection is comprised of files documenting the development and daily operations of the
        Feminist Women's Health Center, a feminist non-profit women's healthcare center, from the
        years 1973-2003. Major components of the collection include files from research studies
        conducted at the center, policies and procedures for maintaining the center, and incidents
        of anti-abortion protests at the center, specifically involving the group Operation Rescue.
        The National Abortion Federation, the professional association of abortion providers in the
        United States and Canada, also figures prominently throughout these records. The collection
        is organized into six series: Administrative Files, Clinic Files, Subject Files, Financial
        Material, Legal Files, and Audiovisual Material. The collection also contains a physically
        separate Closed Series, comprised of materials from the prior six series that are currently
        closed to research.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection is comprised of files documenting the development and daily operations of the
        Feminist Women's Health Center (FWHC), a feminist non-profit women's healthcare center, from
        the years 1974-2003. Major components of the collection include files from research studies
        conducted at the center, policies and procedures for maintaining the center, and incidents
        of anti-abortion protests at the center, specifically involving the group Operation Rescue.
        The National Abortion Federation, the professional association of abortion providers in the
        United States and Canada, also figures prominently throughout these records. The collection
        is organized into six series: <emph render="bold">Administrative Files</emph>, <emph
          render="bold">Clinic Files</emph>, <emph render="bold">Subject Files</emph>, <emph
          render="bold">Financial Material</emph>, <emph render="bold">Legal Files</emph>, and <emph
          render="bold">Audiovisual Material</emph>. The collection also contains a physically
        segregated <emph render="bold">Closed Series</emph>.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Administrative Files Series</emph> most clearly documents the
        day-to-day operations of the FWHC. Materials in this series include policies, procedures,
        and guidelines for operation of the center; minutes and notes from a range of meetings held
        by the center; personnel files; and schedules. This series contains four subseries: General
        Administrative Files, Meetings, Personnel Files, and Schedules.</p>
      <p>Materials in the <emph render="bold">Clinic Files Series</emph> include a range of records
        related to clinical services provided and research studies conducted at the FWHC. This
        series has been divided into four subseries: Statistics, Laboratory Statistics, Research,
        and Patient Education Information.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Subject Files Series</emph> includes files maintained by the staff
        of the FWHC on a range of topics related to women's health issues, events, local
        information, and other women's health clinics. This series contains two subseries: a General
        subseries which covers these subjects broadly, and an Anti-Abortion Violence subseries which
        focuses specifically on anti-abortion protests at the FWHC and other locations, the
        anti-abortion movement in the United States, and pro-choice efforts to counter this
        movement.</p>
      <p>Items in the <emph render="bold">Financial Material Series</emph> consist of records,
        reports, and files documenting the financial situation of the FWHC between the years 1982
        and 2001. These files detail the intricacies involved in operating a women's health clinic
        from a financial standpoint.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Legal Files Series</emph> contains files related to legal issues
        faced by the FWHC, including lawsuits and legislation which would affect women's
        reproductive health and the clinic.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Material Series</emph> consists of 28 audiocassettes
        and 11 videocassettes. Audiocassettes are primarily recordings of workshops, conference
        sessions, and events. Videocassettes are primarily educational. One videocassette documents
        anti-abortion protesters outside the FWHC.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Closed Series</emph> consists of sensitive materials removed from
        the previous six series and CLOSED to research.</p>

            <p>Two large-scale studies including patients of the FWHC as participants were conducted
              at the Center and are documented in this collection. One of these studies investigated
              the use of cervical caps as a method of contraception and the other investigated the
              use of mifepristone and misoprostol (M&amp;M) to medically induce abortion.</p>

              <p>The FWHC carried out a study over a period of 9 years on the use of cervical caps.
                Extensive files in this subseries document the protocols of the study, research
                conducted about various types of cervical caps, yearly reports, and correspondence.
                A significant number of survey response cards completed anonymously by participants
