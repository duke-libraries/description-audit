         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Mary McMillan Papers, 1936-1997 and undated (bulk 1952-1991), consist chiefly of
            journals and printed material, but also include correspondence, writings and speeches,
            photographic material, scrapbooks, clippings, videocassettes, audio cassettes, and
            memorabilia. Arranged in nine series based primarily on the format of the material, the
            papers illuminate the personal life and professional work of McMillan, a United
            Methodist missionary and teacher at the Hiroshima Jo Gakuin College in Hiroshima, Japan.
            In addition to her work as a teacher, the collection documents McMillan's service to the
               <emph render="italic">Kyodan</emph>, a unifying organization for Christian
            missionaries in Japan, and to the <emph render="italic">hibakusha</emph>, the survivors
            of the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as her peace activism.
            Also included are materials related to the Topaz Relocation Center, a Japanese-American
            internment camp in Utah where McMillan worked in 1943. The papers are mostly in English,
            but include some Japanese language materials.</p>
         <p>The bulk of the collection consists of the <emph render="bold">Journals Series</emph>,
            whose 43 journals contain almost daily accounts of McMillan's work at Hiroshima Jo
            Gakuin College, her involvement with the Ushita Christian Church, and her encounters
            with friends and other people. Also included are her personal thoughts about world
            events, particularly those related to peace and nuclear disarmament. Beginning on Aug.
            11, 1939 with the final preparations for her initial departure, McMillan records her
            activities through her first year and a half in Japan. The 1939 and 1940 journals
            document in depth McMillan's adaptation to life in Japan, including her training in the
            Japanese language and customs, her first visits to various cities throughout the
            country, and the difficulties she faced as an American woman in pre-World War II Japan.
            After she and other American workers in Hiroshima were forcibly evacuated on Feb. 29,
            1941, journal entries are scarce; however, the almost-daily entries resume in 1952 and
            continue until the day of McMillan's death on July 19, 1991.</p>
         <p>In addition to the journals, McMillan's professional work as a United Methodist
            missionary and teacher at Hiroshima Jo Gakuin College is well documented through the
               <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph>, <emph render="bold">Writings and
               Speeches Series</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Printed Material Series</emph>. The
               <emph render="bold">Biographical Material Series</emph> includes McMillan's
            handwritten autobiographical notes, as well as newspaper and magazine clippings and
            booklets documenting McMillan's work at Hiroshima Jo Gakuin College, and with the Ushita
            Christian Church, which McMillan helped found in 1948. McMillan's correspondence also
            sheds light on her work through "mission letters," mass mailings which she wrote
            periodically as a way of updating her supporters in the United States on her work in
            Hiroshima.</p>
         <p>McMillan also was a staunch advocate of world peace and nuclear disarmament, and after
            her retirement from the United Methodist Church in 1980, she spent much of her time
            writing letters and speaking in churches throughout the United States promoting her
            cause. McMillan's role as a pacifist is well well documented throughout the entire
            collection by her correspondence, photographs of demonstrations and marches, printed
            materials, and items in the <emph render="bold">Clippings Series</emph>. Much of the
            material in the <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches Series</emph> and the <emph
               render="bold"> Printed Material Series</emph> is related to peace activism, and
            covers topics such as the lingering effects of the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima and
            that city's fight for peace, the first-hand accounts of bomb survivors, and the United
            Methodist Church's pacifist stance.</p>
         <p>Also contributing to an understanding of McMillan's life, the <emph render="bold"
               >Photographic Material Series</emph> and the <emph render="bold">Memorabilia
               Series</emph> offer visual and three-dimensional documentation of her activities as a
            missionary, teacher, and friend to the Japanese. </p>

               <p>Contains 43 journals maintained by McMillan during her time in Hiroshima and her
                  retirement, documenting in great detail her daily life and work as well as her
                  travels throughout East Asia. She also noted her thoughts and concerns about world
                  events and her peace activism. Many entries describe visits by her students and
                  friends in Japan and provide a revealing look at Japanese social life and customs.
                  The journals are arranged chronologically. Many small groups of loose materials
                  were found laid into the beginning or end of the journals; these were removed and
                  placed in a separate folder following the journal; some of these items appear to
                  be unrelated to the journals in which they were found.</p>

               <p>Personal and professional correspondence of Mary McMillan, divided into outgoing
                  and incoming subseries and arranged in chronological order. The <emph
                     render="bold">Outgoing Correspondence</emph> primarily contains letters sent by
                  McMillan to churches or individuals in the United States who had supported her
                  work in Japan. These "mission letters" describe McMillan's work at Hiroshima Jo
                  Gakuin College and Ushita Christian Church as well as her beliefs in world peace
                  and disarmament. Some of the <emph render="bold">Incoming Correspondence</emph>,
                  particularly in the early 1980s, is in Japanese. The majority of the letters are
                  to McMillan from friends, missionaries, and former students in Japan after her
                  retirement in 1980. Also included in a small third subseries is other
                  correspondence that was neither to nor from McMillan. Many of these letters were
                  written to Jane Greenwood, McMillan's sister, from individuals and organizations
                  expressing their condolences over McMillan's death. A few pieces of correspondence
                  have photographs clipped to them.</p>

               <p>Divided into two subseries for photographs and for slides; the material is further
                  organized by subject matter. There are images of the Topaz Relocation Center in
                  Utah, Hiroshima Jo Gakuin College, McMillan's friends, former students and their
                  families. Other images document her travels throughout East Asia, including trips
                  to China and Taiwan. The bulk of the material consists of black-and-white and
                  color casual snapshots of McMillan, her Japanese friends, and her former students
                  with their families. These photographs document Japanese wedding traditions and
                  other ceremonies as well as various marches and activities promoting peace and
                  nuclear disarmament. There are ten images taken at the Topaz Japanese internment
                  camp; most of the photographs were labeled with names and sometimes dates. The
                  slides are in color and consist chiefly of images from McMillan's travels. All
                  materials are arranged in chronological order</p>

               <p>Contains five folders, whose contents include three Japanese-style paper dolls, an
                  origami crane, and other small sketches and paintings; 15 business cards,
                  primarily printed in both English and Japanese; three buttons collected from peace
                  rallies or United Methodist Church meetings; and certificates presented to
                  McMillan by various organizations for her social activism. Also included is a
