      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Meredith Tax was born in Wisconsin on September 18, 1942. She was educated in the Milwaukee
        public school system and at Brandeis University, where she graduated magna cum laude, Phi
        Beta Kappa and with Woodrow Wilson and Fulbright fellowships. She then studied at the
        University of London where she became involved in the anti-war movement. Returning to the
        U.S. in 1968, she continued her anti-war activism and was one of the founding members of
        Boston's Bread and Roses collective, a socialist feminist group.</p>
      <p>Her essay, <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Woman and Her Mind: The Story of Daily
          Life</title>, (1970) is often considered a founding document of the woman's movement and
        is one of the first texts to discuss sexual harassment. Then moving to Chicago, she worked
        in factories and as a nurses aide and continued her activism in the Chicago Women's
        Liberation Union.</p>
      <p>In 1976, she moved to New York, and was founding cochair of the Committee for Abortion
        Rights and Against Sterilization Abuse (CARASA), which helped start the Reproductive Rights
        National Network, of which she was a steering committee member. She also was a parent
        initiator of an alternative public elementary school in District 3 in New York.</p>
      <p>Tax's writings include a history book, <title type="simple" render="italic">The Rising of
          the Women: Feminist Solidarity and Class Conflict</title> (1980), two historical novels,
          <title type="simple" render="italic">Rivington Street</title> (1982) and <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Union Square</title> (1988), and a children's picture book,
          <title type="simple" render="italic">Families</title> (1981).</p>
      <p>In 1986, Tax and Grace Paley initiated the PEN American Center Women's Committee and became
        its co-chairs; she later became founding Chair of International PEN's Women Writers'
        Committee and, in 1994, was founding President of Women's WORLD, a global free speech
        network that fights gender-based censorship.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Meredith Tax papers include materials from the activist organizations she was involved
        with, as well as drafts and manuscripts of her written work, some personal correspondence,
        teaching materials, and audio/visual materials. </p>
      <p>The largest group of materials at over 130 boxes documents Tax's long career as an
        activist, beginning with her involvement in Boston's Bread and Roses, a socialist-feminist
        collective through her continued work with Women's WORLD, a global free speech network Tax
        cofounded in 1994 to fight gender-based censorship. Other organizations Tax was involved in
        are also well documented in the collection, including CARASA (Committee for Abortion Rights
        and Against Sterilization Abuse); PEN American Center Women's Committee; and International
        PEN Women's Writers Committee. Smaller amounts of material come from Tax's work with the
        October League, Chicago Women's Liberation Union, National Writers' Union, and the West Side
        Community School, as well as other organizations. These materials include committee and
        board materials, events files, conferences, and many files of organizational notes and
        records.</p>
      <p>Tax's work as a writer, including books, both fiction and nonfiction, articles, essays, and
        speeches as well as songs, is represented in the Writings, Speeches, and Songs series. The
        Correspondence series includes both personal and professional correspondence. The Subject
        Files were created by Tax for research related to her activism and her writing.</p>
      <p>Finally, there are 89 audiocassettes, 53 of which contain Tax's research interviews and 36
        of which contain interviews with Tax, readings by Tax and board meetings. Other interviews
        are on several VHS videocassettes and optical discs.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>Series contains materials relating to the various activist organizations Meredith Tax
            has been a part of beginning in the 1960s through the first decade of the twentieth
            century. Those with the most extensive documentation are Bread and Roses, a Boston based
            socialist-feminist organization; CARASA (Committee for Abortion Rights and Against
            Sterilization Abuse); PEN American Center Women's Committee; International PEN Women's
            Writers Committee; and Women's WORLD. Other organizations Tax was a part of and are
            documented in this series include the October League; the Chicago Women's Liberation
            Union; National Writers Union; the West Side Community School; and the Center for
            Secular Space (CSS), the INGO founded by Tax. </p>
          <p>The records in this series documents the activities, both internal and external, of
            these organizations and include executive board and committee records, program files,
            reports, conference files, correspondence, information on grants and fundraising
            activities, and research files related to the organizations' missions. Tax's original
            folder titles have been retained where possible.</p>
          <p>Tax was a founding member of many of these organizations, so material from the
            inception of these organizations is often included. Tax's work with both PEN American
            and International PEN focuses on gender-based censorship, and Women's WORLD is an
            organization she cofounded to continue that work at a global level.</p>
