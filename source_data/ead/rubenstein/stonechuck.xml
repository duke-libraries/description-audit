         <abstract id="aspace_59fbc5ad2e91fc357a860d737ddf3c11">Charles Sumner (Chuck) Stone is a
            prominent African-American journalist, with a career spanning from his early days at the
            New York Age (1958-1959) to his position as editor and columnist at the Philadelphia
            Daily News (1972-1991). Between 1965 and 1967 he was special assistant and press
            secretary to New York representative Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. He served as mediator
            between the police and suspected criminals for over 20 years, most notably in his
            negotiation of the Graterford Prison hostage crisis in 1981. He is the author of
            multiple books, from political analyses to a novel about his time with Powell and (in
            2003) a children's book. He was also an educator for many years, as Professor of English
            at the University of Delaware from 1985-1991 and Walter Spearman Professor of Journalism
            at UNC-Chapel Hill from 1991 to 2005, when he retired. The collection contains
            clippings, correspondence, writings, scrapbooks, photographs, research files, and
            printed materials pertaining to the life and career of Chuck Stone. The papers span the
            years 1931-2007 and document Stone's journalism career and writings, his political
            career and relationship with Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., and his role as an
            educator.</abstract>

         <p>The <emph render="bold">Chuck Stone Papers</emph> span the years 1931 to 2007. The
            collection consists of clippings and other print materials, correspondence, writings,
            scrapbooks, photographs, a videotape, research files, and diplomas and certificates
            pertaining to the life and career of Chuck Stone. Of the subject areas documented here
            are Stone's career as a prominent African-American journalist, his political career and
            relationship with Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. (including Powell's time as head of the
            Congressional Committee on Education and Labor), his role as a mediator between suspects
            and the criminal justice system, and his involvement in civil rights struggles in the
            United States. Also represented, but to a much lesser extent, is his teaching career at
            the University of Delaware and UNC-Chapel Hill. The collection is divided into nine
            series, each described below. Of these, the largest by far are the <emph render="bold"
               >Clippings</emph> and the <emph render="bold">Subject Files</emph> series, which
            document respectively Stone's journalistic writings (especially during his time at the
               <title type="simple" render="italic">Philadelphia Daily News</title>) and his
            research interests over the years, including racial politics in the U.S.,
            African-Americans in the media, the criminal justice system, censorship and free speech,
            and standardized testing. The collection was acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin
            Collection of African and African-American Documentation.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. Congressional Series</emph> documents
            Stone's time as press secretary and special assistant to Powell. It contains office and
            business correspondence both to and from Stone; clippings and other printed materials
            about Powell or the Committee on Education and Labor; office files on individual members
            of congress (notably Florida Democrat Sam Gibbons, partly responsible for the campaign
            to remove Powell from his position as head of the Committee); files related to the
            workings of the Committee; press releases written by Stone; and a number of papers
            relating to Powell's exclusion from Congress in 1967. This series should be useful both
            for those interested in the career of Powell, since Stone worked for him during a
            pivotal time in his career, and for those interested in the workings of the Committee on
            Education and Labor during that time.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Clippings Series</emph> is made up predominantly of Stone's
            columns from the <title type="simple" render="italic">Philadelphia Daily News</title>
            and the <title type="simple" render="italic">NEA Viewpoint</title> (a Newspaper
            Enterprise Association column syndicated by United Media), as well as articles about
            Stone from various newspapers, and some writings by Stone appearing in other newspapers.
            Topics addressed by Stone in his columns include racial politics in the U.S.,
            Philadelphia politics, the media, Ireland, Stone's travels in Africa, women's issues and
            feminism, the criminal justice system, and standardized testing. Researchers interested
            in Stone's journalism career prior to 1972 will find some earlier clippings here, but
            should consult the <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks Series </emph> for more extensive
            materials and clippings from that period.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> contains correspondence to and from
            Stone relating to business and personal matters. The majority of this series is made up
            of general correspondence or correspondence relating to Stone's position as editor and
            columnist of the <title type="simple" render="italic">Philadelphia Daily News</title>.
            The remainder of the series comprises topical folders of correspondence, such as the
            correspondence between Stone and Edward M. Ryder, an inmate at Graterford Prison. Other
            such correspondence can be found in the "Criminal justice system" subsection of the
               <emph render="bold">Subject Files Series</emph>.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Other Writings Series</emph> houses Stone's writings not
            contained in the <emph render="bold">Clippings Series</emph>, such as speeches, sermons,
            and television transcripts; business documents and research files pertaining to
            different projects on which Stone worked, such as his attempts to develop his own life
            or his writings on Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. into a movie, or various uncompleted book
            projects; and a small subset of writings by others, including an autobiography of
            Corinne Huff on which Stone worked. It is divided into three subseries to accommodate
            the restriction on the collection: the <emph render="bold">Published Writings by Stone
               Subseries</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Unpublished Writings by Stone
               Subseries</emph>, and the <emph render="bold">Writings by Others Subseries</emph>.
            Notably absent from this series are manuscripts of Stone's books. Instead, the series
            contains either shorter published materials, such as publicly delivered speeches, or
            working documents assembled for the creation of larger works.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks Series</emph> houses the contents of four scrapbooks
            assembled by Stone during the 1950s and 1960s. They contain a number of clippings,
            programs, and some correspondence pertaining to his time at the <title type="simple"
               render="italic">New York Age</title>, the <title type="simple" render="italic"
               >Washington Afro-American</title>, the <title type="simple" render="italic">Chicago
               Defender</title>, and working for Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. The series is especially
            useful for documenting Stone's early career and his position as an outspoken
            African-American journalist and defender of civil rights. Researchers interested in this
            period in Stone's life should also consult the <emph render="bold">Clippings
               Series</emph> for more materials from the period in question that are not present in
            the scrapbooks.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">St. Louis Series</emph> is a small series housing clippings and
            correspondence related to Stone's brief position as ombudsman for the <title
               type="simple" render="italic">St. Louis Post-Disptach</title>, overseeing their
            coverage of the 1997 mayoral election. The series is divided into a <emph render="bold"
               >Published Materials Subseries</emph>, which houses clippings from the Post-Dispatch
            and related newspapers, and an <emph render="bold">Unpublished Materials
               Subseries</emph>, in which can be found correspondence, business documents, and
            responses to several readers polls conducted by Stone.</p>
         <p>In the <emph render="bold">Subject Files Series</emph> can be found Stone's research
            files on different subject areas, arranged alphabetically. The files contain primarily
            clippings, but also some correspondence and notes. Several subcategories that are
            heavily represented and should be mentioned are the files on censorship and the first
            amendment, on the criminal justice system, on standardized testing, and on materials
            relating to his time at UNC-Chapel Hill. There are also numerous files related to racial
            politics in the U.S., but these files are less discrete than the categories described
            above and are to be found throughout the series rather than under a specific
            subheading.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Teaching Materials Series</emph> contains a small amount of
            material pertaining to Stone's teaching career. The bulk of this series comes from his
            time at UNC-Chapel Hill, and includes syllabi, exams, assignments, student papers, and
            other teaching paperwork. Most heavily represented in this regard is Stone's popular
            class on censorship, for which there are multiple syllabi and exams from different years
            and semesters.</p>
         <p>Finally, the <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials Series</emph> collects
            photographs touching on all aspects of Stone's life, from press photos of Stone and Adam
            Clayton Powell, Jr. to family portraits. Also included in this series are a videotape of
            a documentary about Powell, press passes and identification badges, and an election pin
            kept by Stone.</p>
         <p>Unprocessed <emph render="bold">Addition 2009-0009</emph> (50 items; .2 lin. ft.; dated
            1963-2005) comprises primarily photographs, but also contains a few letters, clippings,
            awards, and a dvd-r. The original DVD-R is closed to patron use; however, the
            information on the disk has been migrated to the electronic records server.</p>
         <p>Addition 2012-0099 has been processed and included in the original collection's
            description as boxes 64-66. Some parts of this addition have been interfiled into
            existing boxes.</p>

         <p>Those interested in Chuck Stone and his life may also wish to consult the <emph
               render="bold">Davis Family Papers</emph>, also housed at the David M. Rubenstein Rare
            Book &amp; Manuscript Library, which contain materials collected by Stone's wife Louise
            Davis Stone pertaining to the Davis family and their activities. This collection,
            cataloged separately from the Chuck Stone Papers, is searchable by title in the Duke
            University Libraries online catalog.</p>

               <p>Series is comprised of clippings kept by Stone. The bulk of these are Stone's
                  columns in the <title type="simple" render="italic">Philadelphia Daily
                     News</title> (1972-1991) and <title type="simple" render="italic">NEA
                     Viewpoint</title> (1987-1995), which deal with topics such as racial politics
                  in the U.S., Philadelphia politics, the media, Ireland, Stone's travels in Africa,
                  women's issues and feminism, the criminal justice system, and standardized
                  testing, among others. Also included are materials documenting Stone's early
                  journalism career from the <title type="simple" render="italic">New York

                  interests and research; and articles about Stone from various publications. Of
                  interest may also be the selection of clippings from 1972-1974 from the <title
                     type="simple" render="italic">Philadelphia Daily News</title> that Stone made,
                  apparently for a planned sequel to <title type="simple" render="italic">Tell it

                     type="simple" render="italic">Washington Afro-American</title>. These can be
                  found at the end of the clippings from the <title type="simple" render="italic"

               <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
               <p>Contains Stone's correspondence from the 1960s to 2005. In keeping with Stone's
                  original arrangement, some folders are categorized by topic, while others simply
                  house general correspondence within a particular span of years.</p>
               <p>Of particular interest in the topical folders is the correspondence relating to
                  black political power in America (the topic, not only Stone's book of the same
                  title) and the correspondence with Edward M. Ryder, an inmate at the State
                  Correctional Facility at Graterford, PA from 1973-1993. Also to be found are two
                  folders of correspondence from a number of individuals related to Stone's role as
                  negotiator in the hostage crisis at Graterford in 1981.</p>
               <p>The bulk of the remainder of the series is made up of two categories. One is
                  simply general correspondence. These folders contain correspondence from such
                  figures as Martin Luther King, Jr., Jackie Robinson, Nelson A. Rockefeller, Barry
                  Goldwater, LeRoi Jones, Edward Kennedy, and others, along with family
                  correspondence and business correspondence both to and from Stone from the 1960s
                  to the 2000s. The other is correspondence specific to Stone's position as editor
                  and columnist at the <title type="simple" render="italic">Philadelphia Daily
                     News</title>, which includes internal memos and letters with other staff
                  members, letters from readers, and business letters relevant to his position at
                  the newspaper. Researchers should be aware that these appear to be rough
                  categorizations on Stone's part, and that there are a few letters specific to his
                  role at the <title type="simple" render="italic">Philadelphia Daily News</title>
                  in the general correspondence folders, and some general business correspondence in
                  the <title type="simple" render="italic">Philadelphia Daily News</title>
                  folders.</p>
               <p>It should also be noted that correspondence on particular topics can also be found
                  in relevant series. For instance, correspondence with or relating to Adam Clayton
                  Powell, Jr. is to be found in that series. Researchers interested in Stone's role
                  with the Graterford crisis and his correspondence with prison inmates should also
                  consult the <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Criminal justice
                     system</title> files in the Subject Files Series.</p>

               <p>Series houses the contents of four scrapbooks kept by Stone, disbound for
                  preservation purposes and housed in archival folders. The materials document
                  Stone's media appearances, journalism career, and public relationship with Adam
                  Clayton Powell, Jr. from the 1950s to the end of the 1960s. Each scrapbook deals
                  with a different period of Stone's life, as designated by the bulk dates for each
                  scrapbook, and has been supplied by the archivist with an appropriate name. The
                  first houses clippings, mostly from the <title type="simple" render="italic">New
                     York Age</title>, documenting Stone's time with that newspaper. The second
                  includes clippings, programs, and correspondence collected while Stone was
                  correspondent for and editor of the <title type="simple" render="italic"
                     >Washington Afro-American</title>. It also contains several columns by Stone in
                  the <title type="simple" render="italic">New York Citizen-Call</title>, letters by
                  Stone that appeared in the <title type="simple" render="italic">New York
                     Times</title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">The Washington, D.C.
                     Evening Star</title>, and a number of clippings about Stone from various
                  Washington and national newspapers. The third scrapbook houses clippings,
                  programs, leaflets, and a small amount of correspondence documenting Stone's time
                  in Chicago, where he was columnist for and editor of the <title type="simple"
                     render="italic">Chicago Defender</title> and, later, television commentator for
                     <title type="simple" render="italic">WCIU Chicago</title>. The Powell scrapbook
                  documents Stone's activities as press secretary and special assistant to Adam
                  Clayton Powell, Jr. and contains clippings, correspondence, programs, leaflets,
                  and flyers, as well as a folder of miscellaneous articles and media appearances by
                  Stone spanning from the 1960s to 1990.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
               <p>Houses Stone's extensive files in many different subject areas, consisting
                  primarily of clippings, but also containing notes on the topics and some minimal
                  correspondence. The folders have been preserved as closely to their original order
                  as possible, and Stone's titles have been retained. The exception to this is a set
                  of subheadings that were added to four groups of folders that were physically and
                  topically associated by Stone, and which are of particular interest. These are his
                  files on censorship and the first amendment, on which he intended to write a book
                  ( <title type="simple" render="italic">Free Speech and Jealous Mistresses</title>,
                  unpublished) and taught regularly throughout the 1990s; on the criminal justice
                  system, focused around issues of racism within that system and on Stone's
                  activities as a mediator between the police and inmates or suspected criminals; on
                  the politics and racial bias of standardized testing, an issue with which he
                  became involved while working with the Education and Labor Committee under Adam
                  Clayton Powell, Jr.; and files relating to his academic career, activities, and
                  institutional politics at the University of North Carolina. These can be found
                  under the subheadings <title type="simple" render="doublequote"
                     >Censorship,</title>
                  <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Criminal justice system,</title>
                  <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Standardized testing,</title> and <title
                     type="simple" render="doublequote">UNC</title> respectively. The files on
                  censorship are especially numerous (filling six archival boxes) and contain
                  extensive information on censorship law, types of censorship, and individual
                  instances of censorship. Other topics in this series include black political power
                  in the U.S., minority journalists, women's issues and feminism, affirmative
                  action, religion, electoral politics in the U.S., journalism, multiculturalism and
                  political correctness, higher education, gay and lesbian issues, Philadelphia
                  politics and politicians, and racial politics more generally. There are also
                  significant files on such figures as Mumia Abu Jamal, Jesse Jackson, Martin Luther
                  King Jr., Camille Paglia, Colin Powell, and Clarence Thomas. Subject files
                  relating specifically to Stone's duties as special assistant to Adam Clayton
                  Powell, Jr. can be found in the Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. Congressional Series.</p>
