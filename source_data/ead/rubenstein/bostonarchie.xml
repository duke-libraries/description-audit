      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>African-American graphic artist, professor and advertising executive based primarily in
        California; principal in the firm Archie Boston Graphic Design. Born 1943, in Clewiston,
        Florida and grew up in St. Petersburg, Florida. After graduating from Chouinard Art
        Institute in Los Angeles with a BFA in Advertising Design, Boston and his brother Brad
        Boston, formed their own ad and design agency Boston &amp; Boston Design in 1967. In 1969,
        Boston started working for the ad agency Botsford Ketchum. During his eight years with
        Botsford Ketchum, Boston worked with clients such as Pentel, Motorola, and Yamaha.
        Simultaneously he started Archie Boston Graphic Design, an advertising and design agency. In
        1977, Boston received his Master's Degree in Liberal Arts from the University of Southern
        California and was hired as a lecturer in the Department of Art at California State
        University Long Beach (CSULB) where he was a member of the Design department which included
        the Visual Communication Design Program. He chaired the graphic design program for 12 of his
        32 years before retiring in 2009. He was the first African-American elected president of the
        Los Angeles Art Directors Club, where he served two terms. Boston published two memoirs --
        Fly in the Buttermilk: Memoirs of an African American in Advertising Design &amp; Design
        Education (2001) and Lil' Colored Rascals in the Sunshine City (2009). He has also produced
        two historical documentaries, 20 Outstanding Los Angeles Designers and The Black Pioneers of
        the Sunshine City.</p>
