            the period following the Brown decision of 1954 and the Civil Rights Movement. Harris
            was the first African American city councilman in Durham, N.C., and the first black man
            to sit on the Durham County Board of Education. The Rencher Nicholas Harris Papers span
            the years from 1851 to 1980, with the bulk dating from 1926 to 1965. The collection
            consists mainly of clippings, correspondence, legal papers, photographs, printed
            materials, journals and diaries, scrapbooks, oversize maps, and reports relating to
            Harris' work in political and educational affairs in Durham, North Carolina in the 1950s
            and early 1960s as a member of the City Council and the School Board, with emphasis on
            school desegregation, civil rights, and race relations in Durham. Also represented is
            Harris' business career in banking, insurance, and real estate, his role as an official
            of the Bankers' Fire Insurance Company, and his civic activities, including leadership
            roles in the NAACP, Lincoln Hospital, and North Carolina Mutual Insurance, and Mechanics
            and Farmers Bank, all serving African Americans in Durham. Some biographical materials,
            family papers, and correspondence also relate to his wife, Plassie Williams Harris. Part
            of the John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and African American History and
            Culture at Duke University.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Rencher Nicholas Harris Papers span the years from 1851 to 1980, with the bulk
            dating from 1926 to 1965. The collection consists mainly of clippings, correspondence,
            legal papers, photographs, printed materials, journals and diaries, scrapbooks, and
            reports relating to Harris' work in political and educational affairs in Durham, North
            Carolina in the 1950s and early 1960s as a member of the City Council and the School
            Board, with emphasis on school desegregation, civil rights, and race relations in
            Durham. Also represented is Harris' business career in banking, insurance, and real
            estate, his role as an official of the Bankers' Fire Insurance Company, and his civic
            activities, including leadership roles in the NAACP, Lincoln Hospital, and North
            Carolina Mutual Insurance, all in Durham. Some biographical materials and correspondence
            also relate to his wife, Plassie Williams Harris. In detailing the business and
            government official activities of Durham's first African American city councilman, the
            first black man to sit on the Durham County Board of Education, and an active, if rather
            moderate, African American civic leader during the period following the Brown decision
            of 1954 and the Civil Rights Movement, this collection is especially significant for the
            documentation it offers on the problems of city government and race relations in the
            mid-twentieth-century South. Includes a large group of oversize maps of Durham, N.C.

         <p>The Harward and Howard collections focus on Durham N.C. race relations, school
            segregation and integration, and Durham city politicas and government from the
            1960s-1980s. The Lincoln Hospital and N.C. Mutual collections are included here due to
            R.N. Harris' involvement with both entities, as well as the material located within the
            Harris collection relating to the two former collections.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
               <p>Comprised of letters, telegrams, and other types of correspondence, in the form of
                  personal exchanges between Harris and his wife and family; letters dealing with
                  his campaign and election to the Durham city Council in 1953; and correspondence
                  touching on his business activities. Of particular note are letters written to
                  Harris from Carla Myerson (later Eugster) during her stay in England in 1951,
                  which are filled with observations and impressions about England and its contrasts
                  to America, especially on race relations. Starting in the mid-1950s, letters
                  Harris received from Durham citizens give evidence of the effects of the Brown
                  decision; some letters, for example, call his attention to segregation in airports
                  and ballparks. The issue of public school desegregation comes to the fore
                  beginning about 1959. Dispersed among the correspondence are clippings, financial
                  or business documents, photographs, and publications, often attached to the
                  correspondence with which they are associated. The series is arranged in
                  chronological order.</p>

               <p>Comprised of materials concerning Harris' term on the Durham City Council and his
                  service on various committees. The material takes the form of clippings,
                  correspondence, personal notes, and committee documents, including financial
                  papers, maps, meeting agendas and minutes, newsletters and pamphlets, policy
                  statements, proposals, and reports. Materials in three boxes concern Harris'
                  service on the Durham Board of Education, ranging from audit reports of cafeteria
                  systems and book funds to denials to requests for school integration. In addition,
                  there are several subseries that touch on the activities of the Committee on Human
                  Relations, Lincoln Hospital, and the Durham NAACP (for which Harris served as
                  president). The NAACP subseries include an undated "Manual for Workers in NAACP
                  Membership Campaigns," and correspondence and clippings pertaining to the NAACP
                  and its projects. The subseries are arranged in alphabetical order. Unless
                  otherwise noted, each heading represents one folder of material. Some material has
                  been removed to an oversize folder.</p>

               <p>Comprised of bound volumes of personal and business documents relating to Harris.
                  The series is divided into three subseries arranged alphabetically: Appraisals,

                  done by Harris mainly in the Durham area from 1939 to 1964. The appraisal reports
                  include many photographs of commercial and residential properties. The <emph

                  most of which contain little information. The 1955 volume, however, contains the
                  text of several of Harris' speeches and a few newspaper clippings concerning his
                  views on desegregation. The <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks and Albums</emph>
                  subseries consists of a letterbook covering the years 1957-1962, dealing mainly
                  with a testimonial dinner for Harris in 1957 and with his resignation from the
                  School Board in 1962; a scrapbook containing clippings about Durham civic leaders
                  and some snapshots from 1958; a folder of letters and expressions of sympathy to
