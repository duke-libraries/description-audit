         <abstract id="aspace_db10a61b9143944e3bd059bb66cd0165">Muriel Henderson (1920-2009) and her
            husband, Lawrence (Larry), were originally from Tacoma, Washington. They served as
            missionaries to Angola from 1947 to 1969 and eventually retired to Durham in the 1990s.
            The bulk of the papers relate Muriel Henderson's personal and family history (for the
            Woods and Henderson families). She lived with her husband Lawrence (Larry) Henderson in
            Angola doing missionary work from 1947 to 1969 and the collection includes many
            materials from this time (including journals and letters). Henderson kept in touch with
            people from Angola throughout the remainder of her life. The collection also includes
            many materials documenting her family's life in the early 20th century in the Pacific
            Northwest (mostly in or around Tacoma, Washington), including photographs, diaries,
            children's drawings and letters, school report cards, diplomas, letters, recollections
            (many typed) from family members, and ledgers of household expenses. Acquired as part of
            the Sallie Bingham Center for Women's History and Culture.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Muriel W. Henderson was born on June 20, 1920 in Tacoma, Washington, and died on June 9,
            2009 in Chapel Hill, NC. Her family and friends knew her as Ki. She lived a full and
            active life with a wonderful will to experience as much as possible. She spent 22 years
            as a missionary in Angola with her husband Larry, leaving there in 1969 when the
            colonial war for independence made it hard to continue the work. She and Larry moved to
            New Jersey where he worked for the mission board in New York and she worked in social
            services. She loved working with African students at the Africa-America Institute. Ki
            and Larry finished their careers in Florida, first in Leisure City and then at Sun City
            Center. From 1985 to 1991 they lived in Portugal, where they had first gone in 1947 to
            learn Portuguese for their work in Angola. Ki helped Larry research in Portuguese
            archives for his book on the church in Angola. While there, they reconnected with many
            old friends from Angola. In 1991 they moved to Durham, NC and became active in the life
            of Pilgrim United Church of Christ. Ki was a life-long letter writer and corresponded
            with friends and colleagues all over the world.</p>
