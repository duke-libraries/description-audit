         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Herbert Brungs Papers span the years 1969 to 1988, with the bulk from the 1980s. The
            papers document Brungs' activities as the representative to the German trade
            organization GWA and as the executive in charge of further education of employees and
            managers through seminars and classes. Specific topics documented the opening of the JWT
            office in Düsseldorf; the introduction of computers systems at JWT-Frankfurt;
            correspondence with academics interested in the advertising industry; relations with a
            few big clients such as CMA (agricultural industry) and Deutscher Wein (trade
            organization for German wine); communication with the GWA concerning the relationship
            between the industry and politicians; industry excellence awards; and internal and
            external seminars and their evaluations. The collection consists of typed and
            handwritten correspondence; external and internal memoranda; articles and presentations
            (typed or offprints) accompanied by charts and graphs; and some other printed material.
            Approximately 70 percent of the collection is in German. Only correspondence with
            foreign offices and clients as well as some of the subject material is in English.</p>
      </scopecontent>
      <arrangement id="aspace_b539962a6a9bb971f32a6b17e6709e04">
         <head>Collection Arrangement</head>
         <p>The collection is arranged into five series: <emph render="bold">General Files</emph>,
               <emph render="bold">Client Files</emph>, <emph render="bold">Events</emph>, <emph
               render="bold">Organizations</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Writings and
               Speeches</emph>.</p>
         <p> The <emph render="bold">General Files</emph> series documents the day-to-day activities
            and proceedings in the JWT Frankfurt Office during Brungs' tenure: domestic and foreign
            correspondence; memoranda; information on JWT-Frankfurt's workers' council; and
            background information. Topics include the opening of the JWT office in Düsseldorf; the
            introduction and development of computer systems at JWT-Frankfurt; special events
            organized for individual clients; correspondence with academics investigating the
            advertising industry; personnel and financial management; JWT-Frankfurt's internal
            managers' organizational committee; and internal information flow through house
            memoranda.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Client Files</emph> series collects Brungs' papers concerning
            the accounts under his direction. Since Brungs was managing director rather than account
            supervisor at the time of these documents, they reflect management-level discussions and
            decisions rather than day-to-day planning of the accounts. The series documents on-going
            advertising campaigns--through correspondence; presentations; research; and
            briefings--as well as general and economic relations between JWT-Frankfurt and its
            clients. The major accounts in this series are Bacardi (alcoholic beverages); Burger
            King; CMA (agricultural industry); DBV (insurance); Deutsche Bank; Deutscher Wein (the
            trade organization for German wine); Eckes (non-alcoholic beverages); Flachglas; Ford;
            German Fish Council; Kraft (foods); Pepsi; and Platin.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Events </emph>series collects documents pertaining to seminars,
            conferences, classes, and visits organized or attended by the JWT-Frankfurt office.
            These seminars were organized either for the benefit of particular clients on
            anniversaries or when new accounts were being discussed and similar occasions, or for
            members of JWT. They were usually not open to all office members, but were attended by
            selected individuals (some of whose biographies are included in the material) from
            different levels of the company. Internal seminars were not all organized by the
            Frankfurt office, but by JWT offices around the world, especially in the United States.
            Some seminars were given personal names due to their sponsor or inspirer--such as the
            Sam Meek Seminar; the James Webb Young Seminar; and the Stanley Resnor Seminar--and were
            held regularly, others are one-time events. External seminars were organized by outside
            organizations such as Deutsche Unilever and Bernd Rohrbach Unternehmensberatung
            (consulting firm). Most seminars, external or internal, were accompanied by detailed
            evaluations, which in most cases were kept with the information on the seminars. Apart
            from these evaluations, there is fairly little information on the content of the
            seminars and more on their organization and financing.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Organizations</emph> series collects Brungs' papers pertaining
            to GWA (Gesellschaft Werbeagenturen, later Gesamtverband Werbeagenturen), the German
            advertising industry's trade organization. JWT Frankfurt was a prominent member of the
            trade organization and and a number of JWT staff served as executive officers.
            Communication took place on two levels: Rundbriefe, circulars addressed to the
            representative of the companies to GWA (for most of this series, they are kept in the
            correspondence folders); and Chefbriefe, intended for the executive managers of the
            companies and are occasionally marked confidential. The series also documents annual
            comparisons of different companies in the industry (Betriebsvergleich); the annual award
            for exceptional advertisements (the Effie); meetings of the industry leaders;
            communications between the industry and politicians and with European and American trade
            organizations; attempts to standardize the industry; and the reorganization of the
            not-for-profit GWA (Gesellschaft Werbeagenturen) into the profit center GWA
            (Gesamtverband Werbeagenturen) in 1985-1986.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches</emph> series collects speeches and
            presentations by members of JWT as well as outsiders. The topics of the writings range
            from reflections on multi-national advertising; how to get more out of an advertising
            agency; trends in the advertising of alcoholic beverages; and JWT company presentations.
            About three quarters of the articles are in English, the rest in German.</p>
