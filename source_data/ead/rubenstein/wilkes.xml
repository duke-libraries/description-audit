         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>The primary correspondent in this collection is Charles Wilkes (1798-1877), naval
            officer and explorer, who was a collateral descendant of John Wilkes (1727-1797), the
            noted English politician. Charles Wilkes was born in New York City, the son of John De
            Ponthieu and Mary (Seton) Wilkes. From 1815 through 1817 Wilkes was in the merchant
            service on board several ships until he was appointed midshipman in the U. S. Navy on
            Jan. 1, 1818. His naval career was destined to be a rather distinguished, yet
            controversial one. During the next fifteen years he served on board several ships
            including the <emph render="italic">Franklin</emph> and the <emph render="italic"
               >Waterwitch,</emph> was promoted to lieutenant in 1826, and surveyed the Narragansett
            Bay in 1832-1833. Wilkes's scientific achievements were rewarded by his appointment to
            take charge of the Depot of Charts and Instruments in Washington, D. C. in 1833. In 1837
            and 1838 he was involved in further surveying work at the shoals of Georges Bank and the
            Savannah River.</p>
         <p>In 1838 Secretary of War Poinsett ordered Wilkes to command the South Seas Surveying and
            Exploring Expedition. This expedition and the publications concerning it provided the
            primary focus for his career until 1861. This Exploring Expedition, which was absent
            from the United States from 1838 to 1842, had as its chief fields of exploration the
            islands of the Pacific Ocean, the coast of the Antarctic Continent, and the American
            Northwest coast. From 1843 to 1861, Wilkes was assigned to special duty, chiefly to be
            in charge of the Exploring Expedition collections and reports. In 1844 his <title
               type="simple" render="italic">Narrative of the United States Exploring
               Expedition</title> was published, and scientific volumes appeared from time to time.
            In 1842 Wilkes had been tried by a court-martial and sentenced to be publicly
            reprimanded for illegally punishing some of his men. Despite this he was promoted to
            commander in 1843 and to captain in 1855.</p>
         <p>During the Civil War Charles Wilkes took the controversial step of overhauling the
            British mail steamer <emph render="italic">Trent</emph> and removed by force the
            Confederate commissioners James Mason and John Slidell, He saw other service in a
            variety of commands and received promotion to commodore and then to acting rear admiral
            in 1862. Again in 1864 Wilkes was court-martialed and found guilty. Two years later he
            was promoted to rear admiral on the retired list and was placed on special duty for a
            part of 1870-1873, After the Civil War he purchased the iron works at High Shoals, N. C.
            and pursued business interests there for several years.</p>
         <p>Wilkes was married twice: first to Jane Jeffrey Renwick, sister of James Renwick
            (1792-1863) in 1826, and then to Msry H. (Lynch) Bolton in 1854, after the death of his
            first wife, He had six children from these marriages, For further biographical
            information please consult <title type="simple" render="italic">Autobiography of Rear
               Admiral Charles Wilkes. U. S. Navy, 1798-1877</title> (Washington, 1978); <title

            York, 1953); and other sources listed in the Information Folder in box 1 of the
            collection,</p>
         <p>John (''Jack'') Wilkes (1827-1908), sailor and businessman, was the son of Charles
            Wilkes as well as a correspondent in this collection. Immediately after his appointment
            as a midshipman on September 9, 1841, young Wilkes was sent to sea. He served on the
               <emph render="italic">Delaware</emph> and on the <emph render="italic"
               >Mississippi</emph> in the Gulf Squadron during the Mexican War. His appointment to
            the U. S. Naval Academy came in 1846. After graduation he was assigned to duty on the
               <emph render="italic">Albany</emph> and on the <emph render="italic">Marion.</emph>
            In about 1848 his father had him transferred for a time to work on the charts and
            calculations of the Exploring Expedition. On Nov. 3, 1854, he resigned his
            commission.</p>
         <p>John Wilkes settled in Charlotte, N. C. in December, 1853, probably during a leave of
            absence from the U. S. Navy. He moved to North Carolina to supervise certain mining and
            milling property but in 1858 purchased the Mecklenburg Flour Mills The next year he
            became the proprietor of what would eventually be titled the Mecklenburg Iron Works.
            During the Civil War Wilkes took an active role in the Southern effort through his
            service in the local vigilance committee and the Home Guards, and as a financial advisor
            to North Carolina state officials. Wilkes also became a railroad contractor in
            government service.</p>
         <p>In August, 1869 Wilkes obtained a charter for the First National Bank of Charlotte and
            served as its first president until 1869. This bank had the distinction of being the
            first national bank established south of Richmond. Wilkes formed a business partnership
            in the Rock Island Woolen Mills, but after its failure he devoted his energy to the
            successful Mecklenburg Iron Works.</p>
         <p>Wilkes married Jane Renwick Smedberg of New York in April, 1854. Mrs Wilkes became a
            prominent Charlotte philanthropist. The couple had nine children, five of whom died at a
            young age. For further biographical information please see <bibref>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The largest section in this collection is the correspondence, 1816-1876. It covers such
            subjects as the naval cruises of Charles Wilkes and his son, John; the Exploring
            Expedition, 1838-1842, in terms of preliminary planning, the voyage itself and detailed
            descriptions of places visited, and publishing the results of the expedition; gold
            mining and milling in North Carolina; the Civil War; and Wilkes family business ventures
            in North Carolina. There are many letters written by prominent persons, including a
            particularly rich section containing letters of scientists in 1848 and 1849. Also there
            is a lengthy series of James Renwick (1792-1863) and Charles Wilkes correspondence.
            Other groups of papers are the clippings, financial papers, legal papers, miscellany,
            printed material, writings, and volumes.</p>
         <p>The correspondence covers a sixty-year span, 1816-1876, with the majority of the letters
            being addressed to Charles Wilkes. The letters commence with one from John Wilkes about
            obtaining a warrant as a midshipman for his son Charles. Most of the early letters to
            1818 are those of John to Charles concerning the son's early naval career and the
            father's advice pertaining to it.</p>
         <p>In the 1820s begin letters from Charles Wilkes while on naval voyages, 1822-1823,
            describing Rio de Janeiro; Valparaiso; and the earthquake, burial customs, and clothing
            in Peru. The bulk of the letters for this period fall in 1825, while Wilkes was in
            Washington, D. C., waiting to take a naval examination for promotion to lieutenant. His
            letters concern social occasions, visiting friends, and prominent personages, including
            President and Mrs. John Quincy Adams and a dinner they gave, Mrs. Calhoun, and Prince
            Achille Napoleon Murat. Wilkes evidently made a conscious effort to contact and get to
            know the <emph render="doublequote">right</emph> people, pertly to further his career.
            Other Wilkes letters refer to the court-martial of Commodore Charles Stewart, at which
            Wilkes was called to testify; two French generals in Washington, Generals Lafayette and
            Simon Bernard; and steamboat and stagecoach travel.</p>
         <p>Letters to Wilkes in 1825 and 1826 relate news about the trade situation in Chile, Simon
            Bolivar, politics and government in Peru, and U. S. Navy commissions. A lengthy series
            of James Renwick (1792-1863) letters begins in 1828 and continues to 1854. Renwick was
            an engineer and educator, professor of natural philosophy and chemistry at Columbia, and
            an authority in every branch of engineering of his day. The letters, which were written
            primarily to Wilkes and to Jane Wilkes, Renwick's sister, relate to scientific and
            family matters Letters of Renwick's sons, Henry and Edward, eminent engineers, and James
            (1818-1895), a noted architect also appear in the papers.</p>
         <p>In 1828 and 1829 letters begin in reference to preliminary plans for an exploring
            expedition. Particularly, Captain Thomas Ap Catesby Jones wrote a lengthy letter on Jan.
            2, 1829, about the proposed expedition. President Jackson had given him command of the
            exploring squadron but later eased him out of command. On May 7 Wilkes wrote to
            Secretary of Navy John Branch about instruments and charts for the planned
            expedition.</p>
         <p>In the 1820s there begin series of letters among Wilkes family members that continue in
            varying degrees throughout the collection. Those included in addition to Charles are his
            brothers John ("Jack''), who resided on a plantation outside Charleston; Henry, a lawyer
            in New York; and Edmund, also a lawyer in New York; and a sister Eliza (Wilkes) Henry in
            Albany, N. Y. There is an extended correspondence between Charles and his wife Jane,
            which runs from 1825 to 1848.</p>
         <p>From July, 1830, to May, 1831, Charles Wilkes was on an extended Mediterranean cruise.
            As a result the collection for this period contains many lengthy letters he wrote to his
            wife that are replete with detailed descriptions of such locations as Gibraltar, Port
            Mahon, Algiers, Tunis, Naples, Florence, and Marseilles. In particular there is an
            expecially good account in September, 1830, of a visit Wilkes made to meet the Bey of
            Tunis and the prime minister at the palace. Also there is information about the French
            expedition to Algiers and the reaction to the French troops. Wilkes also demonstrated
            his interest in cultural and social life through his careful descriptions in Oct., 1830,
            of the National Museum, the San Carlo Opera, and churches in Naples. He also
            participated in much social life while visiting France in Dec., 1830.</p>
         <p>The letters for 1832 and 1833 fill only a portion of one folder. Of note is a letter,
            July 28, 1833, by Charles Wilkes's brother John about the South Carolina militia, states
            rights, Governor Hayne, and politics in South Carolina</p>
         <p>A long series of letters from Henry Wilkes in New York to his brother Charles in
            Washington, D C., appears from 1834 through the 1840s. The topics are primarily business
            and financial matters, sale and management of property, rental houses, and the Jackson
            City Association. Henry also wrote concerning elections in New York, riots there, and
            his attitude toward blacks. Of additional interest are letters in Dec., 1834, one that
            Charles Wilkes wrote to Secretary of the Navy Mahlon Dickerson about measurements of the
            eclipse, and one from James Renwick to Wilkes in reference to the U. S. Coast
            Survey.</p>
         <p>By mid-1836, some correspondence begins to appear concerning preparations for the coming
            Exploring Expedition. For example, Wilkes wrote to John Boyle, Acting Secretary of the
            Navy, in July about instruments he needed for the voyage and requesting funds to
            purchase charts, books, and instruments. In August Wilkes journeyed to England and
            Europe to obtain scientific instruments for the expedition. In 1837 he wrote to Navy
            Secretary Dickerson about his dealings with Edward John Dent, a chronometer maker in
            London, and later about the disposition of instruments purchased for the expedition.
            Other letters in 1838 discuss the organization of the expedition, who will command it,
            speculation as to whether or not Wilkes will go, and plans and preparations for staffing
            and equipment. On June 3, 1838, Mary Somerville, an English scientific writer and
            astronomer, wrote to Wilkec about various aspects of oceanography which were still
            possible topics for inquiry on an exploring expedition. In the last half of 1837 are
            letters about Wilkes's surveying efforts and a report by Mrs. Wilkes on a visit from
            Dolley Madison.</p>
         <p>From August, 1838, to June, 1842, Charles Wilkes was the commander of the U. S.
            Exploring Expedition. Writing from the U. S. Ship <emph render="italic">Vincennes</emph>
            to his wife, his letters are generally lengthy and marvelously detailed. Although little
            information is included about the specifics of the scientific experiments and specimen
            gathering, there is a wealth of information about the people and places visited. It is
            possible to include in this sketch only the highlights of information in the letters.
            Please consult the subjects listed in this Guide for further information. In 1838 and
            1839, the voyagers went to Madeira; Brazil; Valparaiso, Chile; Callao, Peru; the Society
            Islands; and Sydney, Australia. Included is information about the homes, plants, and
            wine-making in Madeira; the President of Chile; travels to various small islands in the
            Pacific Ocean; natives; and social occasions. Also Wilkes referred to discipline
            problems on board ship, the officers in the squadron, the spirit of overall harmony on
            the expedition, and an apparent lack of support for the expedition by the U. S.
            government.</p>
         <p>In 1840, Wilkes noted his sighting of the Antarctic Continent and then the trip to the
            Fiji Islands. This latter stop was particularly poignant for Wilkes because his nephew,
            Wilkes Henry, and a Lt. Underwood were murdered by natives who sometimes practiced
            cannibalism. The voyage was marred by several personnel problems. Wilkes suspended and
            sent home Dr. Gilchrist, a surgeon assigned to the expedition, and had difficulties with
            Joseph P. Couthuoy, a member of the scientific corps whom Wilkes dismissed. Wilkes's use
            of strict discipline was to result later in a court-martial.</p>
         <p>In late 1840 and early 1841, the ships were docked in the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii),
            where he wrote a detailed account of an adventurous trip to explore the volcanic
            mountain, Mauna Loa, and of missionaries in Hawaii, In May, 1841, he noted a stop in
            Oregon and the Columbia River.</p>
         <p>Letters in 1842 concern Wilkes's promotion and court-martial. His name was omitted from
            the list of promotions in the Navy, and he was not promoted to commander until 1843. The
            court-martial charges were primarily the result of his supposed use of harsh discipline
            on the expedition. As mentioned previously he was sentenced to be publicly
            reprimanded.</p>
         <p>There begins in the late 1830s and 1840s correspondence between Charles Wilkes and his
            children, and among the children, which will continue throughout the collection. The
            children with whom he communicated were John (<emph render="doublequote">Jack</emph>)
            (1827-1908); Jane (1829-[18--?]); Edmund (1833-[18--?]), an engineer; and Eliza
            (1838-[18--?]). Other family letters include several from Anne de Ponthieu to her cousin
            Charles Wilkes in the 1830s, and a long series between Henry Wilkes and his
            sister-in-law Jane Wilkes in the 1840s.</p>
         <p>The family correspondence for the remainder of the 1840s during the post Exploring
            Expedition period includes many letters of Henry Wilkes, brother of Charles,
            particularly in 1846 and 1847. They concern business and financial matters, coal
            property in Pennsylvania, and the sale of the Jackson City property.</p>
         <p>During this period John Wilkes (1827-1908) wrote from the U.S.S. <emph render="italic"
               >Mississippi,</emph> which was on a cruise to Pensacola, Vera Cruz, and other ports.
            Contained in his letters is a brief report of Slidell's mission to Mexico, Several of
            his letters are from Annapolis where John was a midshipman at the U. S. Naval Academy in
            early 1847. The others were written from the U. S. S. <emph render="italic"
               >Albany,</emph> which he was on board for a surveying cruise to Mexico and the
            western coasts of Central and South America. While on the cruise in late 1847 and 1848,
            he wrote to his father descriptions of various stopping places such as the Island of St.
            Thomas, Curaçao, and Caracas, Venezuela. In 1848 John was appointed Acting Master of the
               <emph render="italic">Albany.</emph> The next year John's letters to his father
            consist of those he wrote while on board the U. S. S. <emph render="italic"
               >Marion,</emph> and while attached to his father's Exploring Expedition publication
            work for which he traveled to Philadelphia, New York, and Washington, D. C.</p>
         <p>John's younger brother, Edmund, wrote several letters to his family while he was in
            school in Philadelphia in 1846 to 1847. The bulk of his letters during this period,
            though, date from August, 1848, through 1849, from Charlotte, N. C. As a teenager,
            Edmund was given the responsibility of going to Charlotte to oversee some mining and
            milling property there. This extensive correspondence consists basically of reports by
            Edmund to his father and instructions from Charles to his son; as a consequence, much
            information is revealed about mining and milling efforts in the Charlotte area at this
            time. Specifically Edmund gave accounts of grinding ore at the Charlotte and Capps
            Mines, Capps Mine preparations, comments about amalgamation problems, milling ore, and
            working stamp, grist, and saw mills at St. Catherine's Mills Charles Wilkes owned at
            least a one-quarter share of the Capps Gold Mine, and also had a share in a
            co-partnership for the mine called the Capps Company. It was his intention to obtain
            possession of the engine at the Capps Mine and to provide facilities for others to use
            it either for shares or by a tribute system. He also wished to make St. Catherine's
            Mills a business place for grinding all sorts of ores, but none of his ventures in
            Charlotte was ever very successful or profitable.</p>
         <p>In the summer of 1848 Jane Wilkes, the wife of Charles, took a vacation in Newport,
            Rhode Island, a fashionable summer resort area. Her letters in July describe the people
            and activities there. Mrs. Wilkes had suffered a leg injury in June, which worsened over
            the summer. She died in August in Newport while her husband was on a trip to South
            Carolina and also to Charlotte to inspect family property.</p>
         <p>As previously noted there is a series of James Renwick (1792-1863) letters in this
            collection. The correspondence is particularly heavy for the 1843 to 1849 period. The
            letters concern reviewing of the manuscript of the <title type="simple" render="italic"
               >Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition</title> and his calculations
            made from measurements made during magnetic observations on the expedition. Renwick also
            wrote about his attempt to be appointed to the U. S. Boundary Commission, which failed,
            and the beginning careers of his three cons.</p>
         <p>The period, 1848 to 1849, is an especially rich one for this collection in terms of the
            correspondence of prominent persons it contains. From 1843 to 1861, Charles Wilkes was
            assigned to special service, chiefly in Washington, D, C., preparing for publication and
            publishing the information collected on the Exploring Expedition. Much of his
            correspondence during 1848 to 1849 deals with describing and cataloging the specimens,
            such as lichens, collected on the expedition; work on preparing charts; writing,
            editing, and publishing of volumes; and paying the bills for this work.</p>
         <p>In the course of this work Wilkes received letters from many prominent scientists, naval
            officers, senators and congressmen, and statesmen. Please consult the <emph
               render="doublequote">List of Selected Persons</emph> in this Guide for an extensive
            listing of correspondents. Of particular interest are four series of letters: 1. Asa
            Gray, botanist, to Wilkes from 1849 to 1859, writing about work on the botany of the
            Exploring Expedition; 2. Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz, zoologist, corresponding to Wilkes
            from 1849 to 1861, concerning drawings of fish and echinoderm specimens from the
            expedition; 3. Joseph Henry, scientist and first director of the Smithsonian
            Institution, writing, 1849 to 1875, about loans of Exploring Expedition specimens; and
            4. John R. Bartlett (1805-1886), state official and bibliographer, writing in 1849 about
            the sales of the <title type="simple" render="italic">Narrative</title> and the
            publication of a spurious abridgment of the work. Other scientists who corresponded
            include Isaac Lea, James D. Dana (1813-1895), William D. Brackenridge, Titian Ramsay
            Peale, William S. Sullivant, and Edward Tuckerman.</p>
         <p>The correspondence for the 1850s continues two important themes of the collection: the
            continuing work concerning the Exploring Expedition, and gold mining and milling in
            North Carolina. Throughout, there are letters referring to various aspects of the
            Exploring Expedition work, such as descriptions being made of specimens, appropriations
            and bills, as well as letters from many prominent scientists. Examples of such letters
            are Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz writing about the classification and drawings of fish
            specimens, Asa Gray about his work describing the botany of the expedition and William
            Sullivant's drawings of mosses, Spencer F. Baird about his report on the reptiles,
            William Sullivant about the engraving of drawings and publication of his work on mosses,
            and Charles Pickering about his report on the geographical distribution of plants and
            animals.</p>
         <p>Many other prominent persons who were not scientists also corresponded with Wilkes
            during the 1850s, Of interest is a letter dated April 9, 1851, from President Millard
            Fillmore to Wilkes thanking him for sending a copy of his work on meteorology.</p>
         <p>A very long series of letters between Charles Wilkes and his younger son Edmund
            continues from the 1840s through the 1850s, Most of the early letters concern the mills
            at St, Catherine's Mills near Charlotte, N. C.; financial matters; and the fact that the
            mills are not proving to be a very successful venture, In the summer of 1850, Edmund
            returned home and then in September began attending the Laurence Scientific School at
            Harvard to train to be an engineer, The remainder of his letters for this period
            primarily concern his work as an engineer on railroads in Ohio, particularly in
            Zanesville. His letters describe hits work, operations of the Central Ohio Railroad, and
            the many accidents on this railroad in 1858.</p>
         <p>The very long series of letters from John to his father Charles Wilkes continues in 1850
            until 1852 while John is on board the U.S.S. <emph render="italic">Marion</emph> on a
            cruise continuing to places such as Rio de Janeiro, China, and Manila Bay. He wrote very
            lengthy descriptive letters on this cruise. In the summer of 1852 he was working on the
            calculations for observations of the Exploring Expedition and also corresponded while on
            trips to Pennsylvania and Ohio.</p>
         <p>The remainder of the correspondence of John Wilkes as well as that of some others
            pertains to mining and milling operations in the Charlotte area. In 1853 John went to
            North Carolina to be superintendent of the Capps mining operations and presumably to
            continue work begun by his brother Edmund earlier. John wrote about the condition of
            various mines, such as the Capps, McGinn, and Dunn mines; mining operations, such as
            pumping water out of the Capps mine shaft; his brief tenure as agent of the Capps Mining
            Company; problems with the Capps Company; and continual financial problems. By August,
            1855, the Capps Mine was defunct. Charles Wilkes had been President of the St.
            Catherine's Mining Company. John also became involved in milling operations and sent
            back reports about the work, progress, and machinery repairs at the St. Catherine's
            Mills; stamp mills; flour and corn milling; and questions about Wilkes's ownership of
            St. Catherine's Mills. In 1858 John turned his attention to the Mecklenburg Flour Mills,
            which he purchased with William R. Myers. Other correspondence concerns a proposed St.
            Catherine Gold Mining Company, which would have been formed to sell a newly invented
            machine for reducing metallic ores.</p>
         <p>There is considerably less bulk for the 1860s and 1870s than for earlier years, there
            being one box of material for each of these decades. Certain letters in 1860 begin to
            mention the possibility of secession. Throughout the Civil War period are references to
            various battles, ships, naval and army officers, and views on the war. On November 8,
            1861, Charles Wilkes commanded that the British mail steamer <emph render="italic"
               >Trent</emph> halt and be boarded. He then searched the vessel, arrested the
            Confederate commissioners James Mason and John Slidell, and removed them to the U.S.
            Ship <emph render="italic">San Jacinto.</emph> Wilkes's primary error was in searching a
            neutral vessel and seizing the agents on board, rather than bringing the ship into port.
            His actions became quite controversial both in the United States and in Europe. Although
            the British people were outraged by the events, a majority of Lincoln's cabinet
            applauded the act. The matter was finally resolved, though, when Secretary of State
            Seward released the prisoners, realizing that the alternative was war with England. Two
            letters in 1862, written by Michele Costi, a publicist living in Venice, address this
            affair. He wrote a strong defense of Wilkes's actions in the <emph render="italic"
               >Trent</emph> affair. A copy of Costi's, <title type="simple" render="italic">In
               difesa del San Giacinto,</title> is contained in the writings. There is no firsthand
            account by Wilkes of this affair in the collection.</p>
         <p>In July and August, 1862, there is a series of letters from Secretary of the Navy Gideon
            Welles to Charles Wilkes, who was co landing the James River Flotilla at that time. Also
            in 1862 are various orders about ships, crews, and discharges, as well as letters
            concerning aspects of the U. S. Navy, such as health, medical care, surgeons, liquor,
            and deserters. Many of the letters in 1862 and 1863 comment on General George Brinton
            McClellan, particularly after his removal as commander-in-chief of the U. S. Army; the
            Wilkes family favored him. In late 1862 and early 1863 letters refer to the fact that
            Wilkes was passed over for promotion to rear admiral and to his reputation as an
            officer. His wife Mary had much correspondence attempting to secure the promotion.
            Wilkes was not promoted to rear admiral on the retired list until 1866. On June 1, 1863,
            he was detached from the West India Squadron and recalled home. Unfortunately his
            letters for this period at sea, 1861-1863, are not included in this collection. Only a
            handful of letters exist for 1864; two of them are from Wilkes to Gideon Welles
            concerning Wilkes's court-martial.</p>
         <p>Family letters during the Civil War are concentrated mainly in 1862 and 1863, while
            Wilkes was at sea. His wife and two older daughters remained in Washington, D. C., and
            in their letters they discuss prominent citizens of the city, army generals, naval
            officers, and activities there. Many letters refer to business and financial
            matters.</p>
         <p>At the conclusion of the Civil War, John Wilkes's letters from Charlotte to his father
            resume. John was at this time serving as the first president of the First National Bank
            of Charlotte and had resumed operations at the Mecklenburg Iron Works which he owned.
            His letters relate to business and economic conditions in North Carolina and the South
            during Reconstruction, making a start again after the Civil War, and business and
            financial matters. Wilkes was in a partnership that owned the Rock Island Manufacturing
            Company; letters refer to its financial problems. In about 1866, Charles Wilkes moved to
            Gaston County, North Carolina, where he had purchased the High Shoals Iron Works. He had
            a contract of sale, but no deed, so protracted legal battles ensued. The Iron Works
            continued to produce batches of pig iron and manufacture nails. Letters in the
            collection pertain to the Iron Works and its production. Only a few letters exist for
            1868 and 1869.</p>
         <p>The correspondence for the 1870s consists primarily of family letters, mostly written by
            John Wilkes to his father. Letters continue about the problems of the Rock Island
            Manufacturing Company, which had failed in about 1869. Other letters concern the
            Mecklenburg Iron Works, which was at one time called the Mecklenburg Foundry and Machine
            Shops, of which he was proprietor. He also referred to the continued question of
            ownership of the High Shoals Iron Works and the appropriation for the work of the
            Exploring Expedition in 1870. A few other letters were written by Mary and Edmund
            Wilkes, who went to live in Salt Lake City in 1871, but returned to New York later.</p>
         <p>Other letters for the 1870s pertain to the Exploring Expedition. Charles Wilkes wrote to
            Lot M. Morrill about publishing the volumes of the work of the expedition. There are
            letters from Frederick D. Stuart, assistant to Wilkes, concerning funds to finish the
            publication of the Exploring Expedition volumes. It was difficult in the later years to
            obtain this funding from Congress.</p>
         <p>The two clippings are a picture of Charles Wilkes and an article, 1862, concerning
            publication of the results of the Exploring Expedition.</p>
         <p>The financial papers, 1830-1875, include such items as financial statements, Exploring
            Expedition statements, bills, receipts, cost estimate, and a bond.</p>
         <p>In the legal papers, which span the years 1827-1865, are indentures, many of which are
            signed by Charles Wilkes and Richard B. Mason, among other parties. Also included are
            articles of association and other papers for the Jackson City Association, a signed
            approval by Secretary of the Navy Isaac Toucey of a summons to Wilkes for a trial, and
            undated plats. There are court documents, such as agreements, summons, a complaint, and
            a memorandum. Some of these items pertain to litigation concerning a Lynch vs. Wilkes
            family real estate dispute.</p>
         <p>The miscellany consists of papers, 1825-1875. Exploring Expedition items include a memo
            in 1838 concerning the acting appointments as commanders of Charles Wilkes and William
            H. Hudson, magnetic measurements, and in 1858 a few items about revisions to various
            maps and publications of the expedition. Three depositions occur in this section in 1862
            concerning fortifications at Drewry's Bluff. They are written by a deserter from the
            Confederate Navy, a former Confederate soldier, and a New York soldier who had been
            behind Confederate lines. Other Civil War papers in 1863 and 1864 relate to the
            court-martial of Wilkes.</p>
         <p>The printed material spans the years 1849 to 1874. Included is a broadside that General
            John James Peck penned on September 20, 1864, entitled, <title type="simple"
               render="doublequote">Siege of Suffolk-Chancellorsville.</title> The purpose of the
            paper was to debunk the idea that any significant portion of Longstreet's army was
            transferred to Chancellorsville. In the printed material also is <title type="simple"
               render="doublequote">Report on the High Shoals Property in Gaston County, North
               Carolina</title> by F. Winter. This is a proof of the pamphlet written in 1873
            concerning the geology of High Shoals. Other titles are <title type="simple"
               render="doublequote">Working the Gold Mines in New Granada,</title>
            <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Prospectus of the <emph render="italic"

               Zanesville.</title>
         </p>
         <p>While the writings cover the two years, 1862 to 1863, most of them are undated. Included
            is a copy in Italian of <title type="simple" render="doublequote">In difesa del San
               Giacinto,</title> 1862, by Michele Costi. This was a defense of Wilkes's actions in
            the <emph render="italic">Trent</emph> affair. An English translation of this item was
            published as a pamphlet under the title, <title type="simple" render="italic">Memoir on
               the Trent Affair.</title> A copy is housed in the Rare Book Room. Related items are
               <title type="simple" render="doublequote">The Surrender of Mason and Slidell</title>
            written in Wilkes's hand and another article, both of which defend his actions in the
               <emph render="italic">Trent</emph> affair. Copies of <title type="simple"
               render="doublequote">Naval Reform</title> and <title type="simple"
               render="doublequote">Abuses in the Navy,</title> 1862, are also included. Two folders
            contain the sixteen-chapter manuscript <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Trip to
               the Far West</title> by Charles Wilkes in 1863. The narrative is comprised of
            descriptions of the localities visited, including Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana,
            Milwaukee, the Mississippi River, St. Paul, Iowa (especially Dubuque), St. Louis,
            Cincinnati, Erie, New York--Buffalo and Niagara Falls, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey,
            and New York City. <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Canal Trip in Peru</title>
            is listed as being included with the manuscript but is not a part of this collection.
            Other undated writings describe various aspects of New York City, iron-clad vessels, New
            Jersey, and Baltimore.</p>
         <p>The volumes, 1823-1847, include account books of Charles Wilkes, a notebook owned by
            Edmund Wilkes, and <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Notes related to Fejee
               [sic] Islands.</title> There is an account book for the ship <emph render="italic"
               >O'Cain,</emph> 1823, maintained while Wilkes was on a trip to ports in the South
            Atlantic on a sealing voyage. Wilkes was in command of the ship, which was fitted out by
            its owner, Mr. Winship. Other financial records of Charles Wilkes are in three Daybooks
            of Receipts and Expenses, 1828-1829, 1829-1832, and 1833-1835. Edmund Wilkes kept the
            notebook in 1847 while he was a student in Philadelphia. Evidently it was from a
            chemistry course. Charles Wilkes wrote <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Notes
               related to Fejee [sic] Islands</title> from July 15 to August 7, 1840, while on the
            Exploring Expedition.</p>
         <p>Two oversize items are in oversize storage: <title type="simple" render="doublequote"
               >Map of the World shewing [sic] the Extent and Direction of the Wind and the Route To
               Be Followed in a Circumnavigation of the Globe</title> by Charles Wilkes, 1856, and a
            broadside, including a plat of several lots of Charles Wilkes's land in Washington, D.
            C. for sale, May 12, 1874.</p>
