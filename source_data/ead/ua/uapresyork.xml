      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>A largely self-taught educator, Methodist minister, and author of a series of English
        grammars, Brantley York (1805-1891) was asked by Methodist and Quaker farmers in rural
        Randolph County, N.C. to help provide education for their sons and daughters. At the site of
        the former Brown's Schoolhouse, he organized Union Institute Academy in 1838 and met with
        instant success, building two new buildings within a year-and-a-half. Though gratified at
        his accomplishment, he worked extremely hard raising money, and he began to go blind working
        late at night preparing recitations in subjects he had not adequately studied. In fact, he
        recorded in his diary a statement saying he considered his years at Union Institute to be
        "truly onerous." York, however, had found his life's work at Union Institute and though
        completely blind by age forty-eight, he lived to be eighty-six and founded half-a-dozen
        schools, lectured over 8,000 times, and taught more than 15,000 pupils. He served as
        Principal of Union Institute from 1838 to 1842.</p>
      <p>Duke University (Durham, N.C.) was established in 1924 and evolved from the following
        institutions: Brown's Schoolhouse (Randolph Co., N.C.) 1838-1839; Union Institute (Randolph
        Co., N.C.) 1839-1851; Normal College (Randolph Co., N.C.) 1851-1859; Trinity College
        (Randolph Co., N.C.) 1859-1892 and (Durham, N.C.) 1892-1924. </p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
