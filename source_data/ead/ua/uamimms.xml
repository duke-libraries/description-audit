      <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
      <p>Orphaned at an early age, Christine Mimms was raised by her mother's sister in Scotland
        County, North Carolina. After graduating from Gibson High School, she attended Meredith
        College where she was active in government and the debating society. She received her
        business training at Kings Business College in Raleigh. She moved to Durham in 1935 when she
        was hired as a secretary. Mimms served as secretary/executive assistant to six Duke
        Presidents, from President William Few to President Terry Sanford. She married S. C. Mimms
        in 1966 and was an active member of the Watts Street Baptist Church. She helped organize
        both the Durham Theater Guild and the Allied Arts and was a member of the arts society's
        original board of directors. She retired from Duke in 1977. Mimms died in 1990.</p>
