      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>William Thomas Laprade was born in Franklin County, Va. in 1883. As a young adult, he
        practiced speaking in his community's debating society and as a teacher in the Sunday
        School. Laprade received a bachelor's degree from Washington Christian College in
        Washington, D.C. (1906) and taught Latin and mathematics from 1906 to 1907. He was
        concurrently a teacher, graduate student at Johns Hopkins University, and minister of the
        Antioch Christian Church near Vienna, Va. Laprade received a doctorate in History from Johns
        Hopkins University in spring of 1909.</p>
      <p> Later in 1909, Laprade joined the faculty of Trinity College (now Duke University),
        becoming Trinity's first teacher of British and European history. Laprade specialized in the
        history of 18th century Europe and occasionally preached sermons. Students testified that
        his most memorable and successful courses were intense seminars conducted in his home.
        Laprade was Chair of the History Department and Chair of the American Association of
        University Professors during the period after World War II during McCarthyism attacks on
        alleged communists in government. Laprade insisted on total freedom of inquiry for scholars. </p>
      <p> Laprade was manager of the Trinity College bookstore (then known as the "Book Room") from
        1912 to 1926. He spent time in England from 1926 to 1927, acquiring many important English
        books for the bookstore. The books ultimately became part of the library's collection of
        British materials. Laprade was the first editor of the Trinity College Press (1922-1926),
        director of the Duke University Press (1944-1951), and editor of the <title type="simple"
          render="italic">South Atlantic Quarterly</title> (1944-1957). </p>
      <p> Off campus, Laprade was a "Minute Man" speaker during World War I, and lectured on history
        and politics to secretaries enrolled in YMCA army training schools. He was also a charter
        member of the Durham Kiwanis Club, and rumored to have attended every meeting from 1920 to
        1975. Laprade served the State of North Carolina as a member of the North Carolina
        Commission on Race Relations, President of the North Carolina State Literary and Historical
        Association, and executive board member of the North Carolina Department of Archives and
        History. </p>
      <p> Laprade was a member of several professional and honorary societies, including Phi Beta
        Kappa and the Royal Historical Society of England. In April, 1975, Laprade was awarded an
        honorary degree of doctor of letters by Duke University on the occasion of the 50th
        anniversary of the school. The North Carolina Historical Commission passed a resolution in
        1975 honoring the life work of Laprade. </p>
      <p> Laprade was an avid letter writer; his family letters reflect life in the southern United
        States during World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II. Laprade died in June 1975
        at 91 years of age. </p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Contains materials pertaining to the personal and professional activities of William Thomas
        Laprade, educator, historian, editor, and civic leader in the Duke University community.
        Papers include correspondence, notes, reports, printed materials, manuscript materials,
        photographs, diplomas, memorabilia, clippings, student papers, and letters. Materials
        include research and manuscript materials for books on 17th, 18th, and 19th century Europe,
        as well as a letter from Anthony Eyre to his brother-in-law, Sir John Newton, English
        mathematician and astronomer (1660). Correspondence concerns professional interests,
        Laprade's family, the Great Depression, World War I, and World War II. A complete
        alphabetical index to named persons in this collection, including correspondence, can be
        found in Box 16. The oversize box contains materials from the Laprade collection that were
        formerly housed in the map cabinets and the General Oversize collection. Materials range in
        date from 1660-1975 (bulk 1898-1975).</p>
      <p>Personal and Laprade family letters are concerned with family and local news, health,
        church meetings, grain production at the family mill in Rivermont, Va., the 1908
        presidential election, and Laprade's father's voting machine invention. From about 1902 to
        1904, Laprade participated in a large network of correspondence centered in the Weekly
        Courier-Journal newspaper of Louisville, Ky. Students wrote in, under pseudonyms, to discuss
        their ideals and problems. Other correspondence subjects include the effects of World War I
        and World War II on the Laprade family.</p>
