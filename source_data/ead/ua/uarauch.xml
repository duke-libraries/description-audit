         <abstract id="aspace_5672bc3103d54c1fd398c8cc5e99c7ef">Henry E. Rauch was an accountant,
            businessman, and executive who served on the Board of Trustees of Duke University. An
            executive and Chairman of the Board at Burlington Industries, he served on Duke's Board
            of Trustees from 1964-1974. He largely was responsible for the Trustee response to the
            Duke Vigil in 1968 and closely involved with the expansion of the Duke Medical Center
            from 1970-1978. The Henry E. Rauch papers include materials related to Henry Rauch's
            time as a member of the Duke University Board of Trustees, some autobiographical notes
            on Henry Rauch's personal and professional life, and excerpts from Board of Trustee
            meeting minutes related to Henry Rauch. Much of the material related to Rauch's tenure
            in the Board of Trustees was gathered together as a scrapbook, and includes
            correspondence, clippings, photographs, reports, and typed notes on his particular role
            and involvement in events, such as the Duke Vigil and in the development of the Duke
            Medical Center.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Henry E. Rauch papers include materials related to Henry Rauch's time as a member of
            the Duke University Board of Trustees, as well as some autobiographical notes on Henry
            Rauch's personal and professional life. Much of the material related to Rauch's tenure
            in the Board of Trustees was gathered together as a scrapbook, and includes
            correspondence, clippings, photographs, reports, and typed notes on his particular role
            and involvement in events, such as the Duke Vigil and in the development of the Duke
            Medical Center. Also included are excerpts from Board of Trustee meeting minutes
            relating to Henry Rauch, often including handwritten annotations by him.</p>
         <p>The collection is arranged into five series: Autobiographical materials, Duke
            Scrapbooks, Board of Trustees meeting minutes excerpts, Photographs, and Awards.
            Autobiographical materials include copies of typed chapters describing Henry Rauch's
            personal and professional life not including his involvement with Duke University. Duke
            Scrapbooks include materials which were gathered into scrapbooks by Henry Rauch and were
            disassembled prior to their transfer to the University Archives; these include materials
            related to Rauch's involvement in Board of Trustees committees, particularly related to
            the Medical Center and the Duke Vigil in 1968. Board of Trustees meeting minutes
            excerpts relate to the actions and contributions of Henry Rauch, and many include his
            handwritten annotations and explanations. Photographs and Awards both include oversized
            materials, many of which are mounted on boards and were removed from frames. These
            relate to Rauch's involvement with the Board of Trustees, the Medical Center Board of
            Visitors, and outside organizations.</p>

         <head>Historical note</head>
         <p>Henry E. Rauch was born September 21, 1902, near Boston, Massachusetts. The youngest of
            five children, he began working odd jobs while still in grammar school. He attended the
            Boston High School of Commerce, where he could study accounting. In 1918, while still in
            high school, he began working in the office of the Bentley School of Accounting and
            Finance, later Bentley College. After graduating high school in 1920, Rauch entered the
            Bentley Evening Division and graduated in 1924 with a degree in accounting.</p>
         <p>Prior to graduating from Bentley, Rauch began working for the Amoskeag Manufacturing
            Company, a textile company, starting as a bookkeeper in 1922. He was with Amoskeag for
            14 years, progressing rapidly in responsibility. In 1928 he began a seven-year stint
            overseeing the textile mills in Manchester, New Hampshire. During this time, he was
            involved in negotiations with members of the company labor union, closely involved with
            salary negotiations, as well as being a witness to a number of strikes, some violent,
            during the period 1933-1935. In 1936, he assisted with the liquidation of Amoskeag after
            it declared bankruptcy and was affected by a massive flood.</p>
         <p>From 1936-1938, Rauch worked for Peterzell &amp; Gelles, then began working for the
            American Thread Company in 1938. He stayed with American for eleven years, rising to
            Executive Vice President, before resigning in 1949. He then became President of
            Peterzell &amp; Gelles from 1949-1951, before becoming a consultant for Burlington Mills
            in 1951. He worked in this capacity for a brief time before becoming Corporate
            Controller of Burlington Mills, which became Burlington Industries in 1955, and moved to
            Greensboro, NC. He was promoted to Vice President, Executive Vice President, and
            Director before becoming Chairman of Burlington Industries in 1962. Rauch oversaw
            significant growth and expansion of the company before retiring as Chairman in 1967,
            then resigning from all Board positions in 1970.</p>
         <p>Henry Rauch became involved with Duke University in the early 1960s. While his son
            Dudley Rauch was a student at Duke, Henry Rauch became Chairman of the Parents of
            Students Committee and Chairman of the Parents of Students Loyalty Fund from 1960-1963.
            In 1964, he was elected to the Board of Trustees and became an extremely active member.
            In 1965, he was elected to the Executive Committee of the Board, then in 1966 the
            Business and Finance Committee (of which he became Chairman in 1972). In 1968, he was
            appointed to the Investment Committee and as Chairman of the Board of Visitors of the
            Medical Center, as well as helping to create the Trustee-Faculty Liaison Committee. He
            also served on two ad hoc committees, the committee that developed the Policy on
            Pickets, Protests, and Demonstrations, which became effective in 1968, and the committee
            that formalized the operations of the Private Diagnostic Clinic associated with the
            Medical Center. In addition, he served as a member of the special committee to formulate
            plans and establish goals related to the Decade of Destiny, a far-reaching fundraising
            campaign to improve Duke University’s standing as a research university with a large
            number of building projects including a new Medical Center. Rauch was elected Vice
            Chairman of the Board of Trustees in 1970.</p>
         <p>In 1968, during the Vigil that took place on the campus quad in the aftermath of the
            assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., Henry Rauch was appointed the head of the
            Trustee-Administrative Committee organized to deal with demands of students and
            participants in the Vigil, related to the wages and working conditions of non-academic
            employees. In this capacity, he issued the statement of the committee resolving to
            increase employee wages and was instrumental in the wage schedule calculations and
            negotiations. The Policy on Pickets, Protests, and Demonstrations, which Rauch was
            involved with developing, came about as a result of this incident. Also partially in
            response to the Vigil, Rauch helped organize the creation of the Trustee-Faculty Liaison
            Committee. </p>
         <p>Beginning in 1970, when Rauch became a consultant to the Medical Center for the purpose
            of developing a new Hospital, he became increasingly interested in and involved with the
            operations of the Medical Center. He was closely involved with the financial planning
            and structuring of the new Duke Hospital building, called G-94 during planning and now
            called Duke North, and worked closely with Dr. William Anlyan, Vice President for Health
            Affairs at that time. He gave financial gifts to the Rauch Family Cancer Research Fund,
            and later to the Henry E. Rauch Arthritis Research Fund. He was appointed an honorary
            member of the Medical Alumni Association in 1971, the second person to receive this
            honor, and his contributions were also recognized in the dedication of a conference room
            in Duke North. </p>
         <p>In 1972, at the age of 70, Henry Rauch began to withdraw from several of his many
            Trustee commitments. In disagreement with investment advisors and frustrated at the
            slowed pace of committee meetings involving students and faculty, he resigned from the
            Business and Finance Committee in 1972. Concerned with the financial management of the
            Hospital expansion and planning, in 1974 he resigned from the Investment Committee, then
            resigned entirely from the Board of Trustees and all committee work shortly thereafter.
            He continued in an advisory capacity with the Medical Center Committee from 1974-1978
            and remained active in the financial planning of the Medical Center. </p>
         <p>The Board of Trustees and Duke President Terry Sanford voted to award Rauch an Honorary
            Doctorate of Laws in 1975, then to reject his resignation as Trustee and elect him a
            Trustee Emeritus in 1976. </p>
         <p>Henry Rauch met Alice Atkins, a secretary for the Boston office of the Amoskeag Company,
            in 1928, and they married in 1929. The couple lived in Boston until about 1930, when
            they moved to Manchester, NH. Daughter Elizabeth Rauch was born January 18, 1936, and
            son Dudley Rauch was born July 21, 1941. Along with his involvement with Duke
            University, Henry Rauch was also Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Bentley College,
            in Boston, Mass., his alma mater, from which he also received an honorary doctorate of
            laws, and was a member of the Board of Visitors of Charles R. Drew Medical School in Los
            Angeles, CA. Alice Rauch died October 22, 1974, and Henry E. Rauch died January 16,
            1994, of a heart attack.</p>

                  typed notes. The materials were largely in chronological order and had apparently
                  been arranged into three scrapbooks or groupings: Duke 1963-1970, Duke 1971-May
                  360, 1978, and June 1978-1992. Some of these materials were annotated by Henry

                  related to an editorial in the Greensboro Daily News regarding Duke's financial
                  status, including clippings, correspondence, and Rauch's notes regarding his
                  response the editorial. Correspondents of note include Douglas Knight, William Van

                  are from both Board of Trustees meetings and Executive Committee meetings. Many of
                  these excerpts were annotated by Henry Rauch by hand, expanding on or explaining
