        "purse") was Professor of Zoology at Duke University from 1927 until his retirement in 1948.
        Collection primarily contains papers and other items relating to his academic career:
        correspondence, writings and lectures, lab notes and data, fieldwork notes, teaching
        materials, clippings and printed materials, many photographs and negatives, and glass
        slides. Images are of animal and plant life, but also include landscapes, people, villages,
        and social customs from about 1915-1935 in Nigeria and the Yucatán Peninsula, and smaller
        groups from other research trip locations in South America and Southeast Asia, 1910s-1930s.
        There are also early photographs and materials regarding the Marine Biology Laboratory in
        Beaufort, N.C. and other marine labs, as well as images of the Outer Banks coast and people
        such as fishermen. A large group of images consist of illustrations used in Pearse's
        textbooks, articles, and teaching lectures. Prominent subjects throughout the collection
        include the establishment of and research projects at the Duke University Marine Laboratory,
        the promotion of forestry as a scientific discipline at Duke, Pearse's role as editor of the
        publication Ecological Monographs, and his research interests: marine biology, ecology,
        crustaceans, parasitology and parasitic diseases, microbiology and biological adaptation,
        and forestry.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Arthur Sperry Pearse (pronounced like "purse") was born 15 March 1877, on the Pawnee Indian
        Reservation near Crete, Nebraska, where his parents ran a trading post. In 1898, Pearse left
        the University of Nebraska with the 4th Nebraska Volunteer Infantry in the Spanish-American
        War, returning to receive his B.A. in 1900 and his M.A. in 1904. He went on to complete his
        doctoral work at Harvard where he received his Ph.D. in 1908. Also, in 1942, Pearse received
        an honorary LL.D. from the University of Nebraska.</p>
      <p>Pearse taught courses at Harvard, the University of Michigan (1908-1910), the University of
        the Philippines (1911), St. Louis University School of Medicine (1911-1912), the University
        of Wisconsin-Madison (1912-1927), and, finally, as Professor of Zoology at Duke University
        (1927-1948). In 1926, Pearse spent five months at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
        Medicine and one year as a visiting professor at Keio University in Japan (1929-1930).
        Pearse was an instrumental participant in the creation of the Duke University Marine
        Laboratory at Beaufort, N.C., in 1938 and served as the lab's first director until 1945. He
        was also founder and editor of <emph render="italic">Ecological Monographs</emph>
        (1930-1950), a publication of Duke University Press. </p>
      <p>In addition to work within the academy, Pearse was also a special investigator for the
        United States Bureau of Fisheries, a special member of field staff for the International
        Health Board, and a special investigator for the Carnegie Institute. Also a member of many
        scientific societies, he served as president of the Ecology Society of America (1925),
        American Society of Zoologists (1945), and North Carolina Academy of Science (1951), and as
        vice president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1936).</p>
      <p>During his career Pearse authored about 175 publications on a variety of research interests
        in the fields of marine zoology and ecology, microbiology, forestry, and parisitology
        including fresh-water fauna, beach and estuarine animals, the fauna of soil and forest
        environments, parasitic marine crustacea, and biological adaptation. Titles include <emph
          render="italic">General Zoology</emph> (1917), <emph render="italic">The Migration of
          Animals from Sea to Land</emph> (1936), <emph render="italic">Fauna of the Caves of the
          Yucatan</emph> (1938), and <emph render="italic">Animal Ecology</emph> (1939). He also
        published a collection of essays, <emph render="italic">Hell's Bells</emph> (1941), and an
        autobiography, <emph render="italic">Adventure: Trying to be a Zoologist</emph> (1952). </p>
      <p>Pearse's research travels - documented by his own photographs - took him to the Nigeria,
        the Philippines, Japan, Yucatan, Venezuela and numerous locations throughout the United
        States including Alabama, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Maine, Florida, Texas, and coastal North
        Carolina.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Arthur Sperry Pearse papers include the professional papers and photographs of A. S.
        Pearse's scholarly career. His professional papers span the length of his academic career
        and include: correspondence, writings and lectures, lab notes and data, fieldwork notes,
        teaching materials, clippings and printed materials, many photographs and negatives, book
        illustrations, and glass slides. Images are of animal and plant life, but also landscapes,
        people, villages, and social aspects of life from about 1915-1935 in Nigeria and the
        Yucatán Peninsula, and from other research trip locations in South America and Southeast
        Asia, 1910s-1930s. Included are snapshots of fellow scientists in the laboratory and in the
        field. There are also early photographs and materials regarding the Marine Biology
        Laboratory in Beaufort, N.C. and other marine labs, as well as images of the N.C. coast and
        people such as fishermen. A large group of images consists of illustrations used in Pearse's
        textbooks, articles, and teaching lectures. </p>
      <p>Prominent subjects throughout the collection include the establishment of and research
        projects at the Duke University Marine Laboratory, the promotion of forestry as a scientific
        discipline at Duke, Pearse's role as editor of the journal <title render="italic">Ecological
          Monographs</title>, and his research interests: marine biology, ecology, crustaceans,
        parasitology and parasitic diseases, microbiology and biological adaptation, and
        forestry.</p>
      <p>Correspondence primarily reflects his role as editor of <title render="italic">Ecological
          Monographs</title> which includes correspondence concerning receipt of drafts for
        publication, recommended revisions, and future publication dates. Other prominent topics
        include Pearse's involvement with professional organizations, various symposiums and
        conferences, publications, research in Nigeria and the Yucatán, and the founding and early
        operations of the Duke University Marine Laboratory at Beaufort, North Carolina. Also, in
        1938-1939, there is a series of correspondence between Pearse and President William Preston
        Few concerning lack of support for and conditions within the department and Pearse's
        consequent resignation as departmental chair.</p>
      <p>Other materials include research notes, tables, and sketches; graduate student
        correspondence, plans of work, and dissertation abstracts; manuscripts of various
        publications authored by Pearse including <title render="italic">Animal Ecology</title> and
        his 1952 autobiography, <title render="italic">Adventure: Trying to be an Ecologist</title>;
        laboratory and field notebooks containing research notes and statistics from Nigeria, the
        Yucatan, Wisconsin, and various other research locations.</p>
      <p>There are many photographic prints, nitrate and safety negatives, and glass-plate lecture
        slides, all documenting Pearse's research travels, particularly in Nigeria and the Yucatán,
        but also in Alabama, Florida, and coastal North Carolina, Japan, China, Burma, the
        Phillippines, Colombia, and Venezuela. Images include local flora, fauna, landscapes,
        villages, localized crafts and industries, and indigenous peoples, as well as maps, charts,
        tables, drawings, and photographs used in Pearse's lectures and publications. </p>

          <p>Series contains over 1000 photographs and corresponding negatives, a few postcards, and
            glass lantern slides primarily documenting Pearse's research travels abroad and within
            the United States from 1911-1953. Locations with the most photographic images are
            Nigeria and the Yucatán Peninsula, with smaller numbers from the Duke Beaufort Marine
            Lab, the NC Outer Banks, Colombia, India, Japan, China, the Philippines, and Venezuela. </p>
          <p>Photographs of local flora, fauna, and ecosystems include: fish, crabs and other
            crustaceans, insects, and turtles; geological and ecological settings, particularly
            relating to freshwater and coastal zones; cenotes (large sinkholes and caves) in the
            Yucatán; and mixed zones of agriculture and tropical forest.</p>
          <p>Also present are many prints and negatives of charts, maps, animals, and other
            illustrations used in Pearse's texbooks. </p>
          <p>In addition to scientific research photographs, there are images, particularly those
            from Nigeria and the Yucatán, which document local peoples, customs, and activities,
            including dress, religious customs, agricultural techniques, food gathering, and
            architecture such as walled villages and temples. </p>
          <p>Single items of interest include a signed portrait of naturalist and Darwinist T.R.R.
            Stebbing, circa 1915, and a photograph of a group of men from the Association of
            American Universities taken by the Bayard Wooten-Moulton studio in Chapel Hill, N.C.
            sometime before 1954.</p>

            <p>All negatives are closed to use. Access copies are available in the form of

            <p>About half of these sheet negatives have captions written on their edges. There are
              roughly double the number of negatives as there are prints, thus in this subseries
              there are many images not found in paper print format. The most typical sizes are 2
              1/4 x 3 1/4 and 4 x 5 inches. Most are on nitrate film.</p>
            <p>As with the prints, the largest series are from Nigeria and the Yucatán, with about
              200 images each; there are also substantial groups from Beaufort, North Carolina,
              Alabama, Florida, Colombia, China, Japan, the Philippines, India, Thailand, the
              Tortugas, and Venezuela. Many of these images are not found among the prints.</p>
