         <head>Biographical note</head>
         <p>Jay Carl Anderson was a photographer and Duke alumnus who photographed Duke athletic
            events and campus scenes in the 1970s and 1980s. </p>
         <p>Jay Carl Anderson was born in 1956 to Jay C. and Marion C. Anderson. Born in Utica, New
            York, he grew up in Clinton, New York. His father owned an advertising agency and Jay
            Anderson learned graphic arts and photography while still in school, first publishing
            photographs in the Clinton Courier newspaper at age 16. He enrolled at Duke University
            in 1974 and moved to Durham, North Carolina. He became photography editor for the
            Chronicle in his freshman year and began working as a freelance photographer, publishing
            photographs in Parade Magazine and the New York Times while still a student. He covered
            the 1976 Democratic National Convention in New York as well as other political events
            and locations in New York and Washington D.C. He traveled to Europe and the Soviet Union
            for about six months in 1977. In 1976 he joined the staff of the Chanticleer, becoming
            editor in 1978. </p>
         <p>In the summer of 1978, while completing the 1978 Chanticleer, Jay Anderson became
            involved with modern dance and the American Dance Festival, which came to the Duke
            campus that same year. He began frequent collaboration with ADF and became the American
            Dance Festival's official photographer in 1982. </p>
         <p>Anderson remained in Durham after graduating from Duke with a BA in History in 1978, and
            continued to work as a freelance photographer and photojournalist in addition to his
            work with ADF. He took photographs of Duke athletic events, particularly basketball,
            throughout the 1980s, and remained involved with the Chanticleer; he also did commercial
            work in the Triangle and took photographs throughout North Carolina.</p>
         <p>Jay Anderson married Saundra Prescott in 1990. The couple moved to St. Petersburg,
            Florida, in 2010. Jay Carl Anderson died February 8, 2013.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Jay Carl Anderson Photographs and Papers include images of Duke University, Durham,
            Duke athletic events, and many other subjects taken by Jay Anderson throughout the 1970s
            and 1980s. </p>
         <p>The collection includes a large number of photographs taken by Jay Anderson during his
            time as a student at Duke University in the 1970s, particularly images of the Duke
            campus, Duke athletic events, and related topics for the 1978 Chanticleer. Also included
            are images taken in and around Durham after Anderson graduated from Duke, images of
            politicians and political activity at the national and state level, and locations and
            events outside of North Carolina. The collection also includes student materials from
            Anderson's time at Duke and correspondence and publications related to his work as a
            freelance photographer.</p>
         <p>Topics and individuals depicted include Duke's East and West Campus, Duke Blue Devils
            men's basketball games, student life at Duke in the late 1970s, Duke athletic events,
            and scenes around Durham and North Carolina. The collection also includes images of
            politicians such as United States Presidents Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, and Ronald
            Reagan, the 1976 Democratic National Convention, politicians Jesse Jackson, George
            Wallace, and Walter Mondale, and many other subjects.</p>
         <p>The photographs were divided by format and did not include a system to match the same
            image in different formats. Many negatives were grouped into folders with topical
            labels, while many others were individually labeled by roll or completely unlabeled.
            Some negatives were still rolled and uncut, and have been cut to fit into sleeves. Many
            unlabeled negatives were grouped into labeled folders. Many slides were in labeled
            containers, while others were sleeved and grouped into folders. Some negatives and
            slides may contain further identifying information for individual rolls or pages that
            are not included in folder titles. Most prints were unlabeled, and have been grouped
            into labeled folders. Some individual prints, likely submitted for publication to
            clients such as the New York Times, include descriptive captions identifying
            individuals, events, and/or dates. Not all negatives or slides are represented in
            prints, and a few prints may not have corresponding negatives or slides.</p>
         <p>Photographs taken for the American Dance Festival during Anderson's tenure as official
            ADF photographer are held at the American Dance Festival Archives.</p>

                  <p>Includes images taken for the 1978 Chanticleer, most but not all of them
                     photographed by Jay Anderson, as well as images photographed by other
                     individuals for later editions of the Chanticleer. There is some overlap
                     between this subseries and Series 1.1 Campus, Series 1.2 Other, Series 2 Duke
                     Sports, Series 3 Durham and North Carolina, and Series 4.1 Politicians. Many
                     slides in this subseries were labeled with names of staff photographers for the
                     Chanticleer from 1978-1984, and are most likely the work of these
                     photographers. How they came to be included in Jay Anderson's photographs is
                     unknown.</p>

                  captions giving date, opposing team, and/or player names. Images show players
