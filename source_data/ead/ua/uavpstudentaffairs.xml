      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Division of Student Affairs is led by the Vice President of Student Affairs. The office
        is involved in all aspects of student life at Duke University, providing programs and
        services "that support the optimal growth of Duke students, enhance their intellectual,
        social, cultural and physical development, and complement Duke's academic excellence by
        providing opportunities for students to experience education and explore interests beyond
        the classroom."</p>
      <p>The first Dean of Student Affairs was Herbert Herring, who held the position in the 1950s.
        William Griffith became Dean of Student Affairs in 1963, later to be called the Vice
        President of Student Affairs, and served for almost thirty years before retiring in 1991.
        Under Griffith, the office developed the Student Union and Counseling and Psychological
        Services, and was deeply involved in shaping the Duke Publications Board, the Duke Players,
        the Duke Artists Series, the Associated Students of Duke University and its successor the
        Duke Student Government, and many student and student-focused organizations. Griffith was
        Dean of Student Affairs during the Duke Vigil in 1968 and the Allen Building Takeover in
        1969, involved in the administrations response and follow-up to the latter. After retiring
        in 1991, the William J. Griffith University Service Award was named in his honor, and the
        Griffith Board Room in the Bryan Center was named for William and Carol Griffith.</p>
      <p>Maureen Cullins was the Assistant to the Vice President of Student Affairs in the late
        1980s and early 1990s. She is presently (2018) the Co-Director of the Multicultural Resource
        Center at the Duke University School of Medicine.</p>
      <p>Larry Moneta was the Vice President for Student Affairs from 2001 to 2019.</p>

          <p>This series includes materials from William Griffith's time as Vice President for
            Student Affairs. Files are partially alphabetical and include correspondence, reports,
            memorandums, printed materials, and other materials related to student housing, the
            Office of Minority Affairs, the Publications Board, the Chapel (including expansion and
            activities), student activities, the University Union administration and activities,
            materials related to racial and sex discrimination, and other topics. Included are the
            results of a survey administered to students on opinions about the Allen Building
            Takeover (called "Sit-In Study") as well as files on Title IX regulations and segregated
            facilities.</p>

          <p>The materials in this series were created or collected by Maureen Cullins, Assistant to
            the Vice President of Student Affairs during the early 1990s. The series includes
            correspondence, notes, planning documents, budgets, reports, and other materials related
            to the Black on White Symposium (a symposium on the experience of black students and
            faculty at primarily white institutions such as Duke University) and the Richard Whitted
            Institute (a summer program for black students in North Carolina held at Duke).
            Materials are arranged alphabetically, then chronologically.</p>
