      <p>John Saeger Bradway (1890-1985) taught law at Duke University School of Law from 1931 to
        1959, where Nixon was one of his students. Bradway taught in California until his retirement
        in 1970. Bradway was married to Mary Henderson in 1921. He died on January 2, 1985 in
        Eureka, California.</p>
      <p>Richard Milhous Nixon (1913-1994) attended the Duke University School of Law from 1934 to
        1937, graduating number three in a class of twenty-six. During his three years at Duke,
        Nixon was active in the Duke Bar Association and was elected President in his senior year.
        Following school, Nixon began a political career. He was a Senator for California
        (1950-1953), the nation's 36th vice president (1953 to 1961), and was elected the 37th
        president of the United States, serving from 1969 until his resignation in 1974.</p>
      <p>Nixon was the first U.S. president, since Andrew Johnson in 1868, to be the subject of
        formal impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives. The impeachment process
        began on October 30, 1973, following a series of staff firings and resignations known as the
        Saturday Night Massacre prompted by the Nixon administration's attempt to cover-up its
        involvement with the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the
        Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p>On May 9, 1974, formal hearings in the impeachment inquiry of President Nixon began,
        culminating July 27â€“30, 1974, when the Democratic-led Judiciary Committee approved three
        articles of impeachment charging the president with obstruction of justice; injury to the
        constitutional rights of citizens; and the abuse of power. Once Nixon was told his that both
        his impeachment and his conviction were inevitable he resigned the presidency on August 9,
        1974, before the House could vote on the articles of impeachment.</p>
