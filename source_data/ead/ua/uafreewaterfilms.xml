      <abstract id="aspace_c2cba2ac58715fa43dd92a4d6c525908">Freewater Films is a student-run
        programming committee within the Duke University Union (DUU) responsible for both screening
        and producing films. Film exhibitions have included weekly and summer series, as well as
        special event screenings featuring particular directors, actors, or genres. As a film
        production resource, Freewater has provided grants of film stock, equipment, processing, lab
        work, and technical instruction to members of the Duke community. The collection includes
        paper records and various film and tape elements produced by Duke students in the making of
        their original films. Formats include 35mm film, 16mm film, 8mm film, Betacam SP cassettes,
        audio cassettes, VHS cassettes, DAT tapes, as well as DVDs. The collection also includes
        some paper documentation associated with particular films, as well as publicity materials
        and subject files. Film topics include North Carolina environmental issues, poverty in
        Durham, political rallies, faculty interviews, campus construction, and student
        performances. Also included are fictional films on psychological, philosophical, or romantic
        themes, which feature familiar campus locations such as Perkins Library, the Duke Gardens,
        the Chapel, or the Duke Hospital. The collection also includes compilation tapes of entries
        from the annual Hal Kammerer Film Competition, as well as film experiments undertaken during
        Freewater film workshops. The collection is organized chronologically, then alphabetically
        by film title. In cases where the creators had grouped multiple reels of a particular film
        into a small box or a can, these groupings were denoted as reel 1-3 of 3, etc. Where
        available, synposes written on film cans were summarized and included in this finding aid.
        The majority of these synposes were written by Freewater Productions participant Benjamin
        Epps.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Freewater Films is a student-run programming committee within the Duke University Union
        (DUU) responsible for screening and producing films. It is overseen by the DUU Programming
        Council.</p>
      <p>The committee's origins can be traced to 1969, when the Mary Duke Biddle Foundation gave
        funds for students from the Duke University Union Visual Arts Committee to make a 16mm film.
        In November 1970, several students produced an original film entitled <title type="simple"
          render="doublequote">Dying</title>, using a 16mm Bolex camera borrowed from the DUU. The
        following year, <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Dying</title> went on to win first
        prize at the Association of College Unions' 1971 International Film Festival.</p>
      <p>Freewater soon established its mission in two categories: film exhibition and film
        production. By Spring of 1972, the film exhibition program was comprised of two weekly film
        series. One of these took place on Thursday evenings, and featured independent, educational,
        or niche films. The other series took place on Friday evenings, and featured more recent and
        popular films. The Friday series provided much of the revenue needed for both the Thursday
        series, and the film production activities of Freewater members. In addition to these two
        series, Freewater also sponsored a ten-week summer film series as well as several film
        festivals devoted to particular genres, actors, or directors. Additionally, it arranged
        visits by film directors and actors on campus, as well as community outreach initiatives,
        such as a children's film series, and discounted tickets for underprivileged youth.</p>
      <p>As a film production resource, Freewater provided grants of film stock, equipment,
        processing, lab work, and technical instruction to members of the Duke community. It also
        funded several independent studies and one Duke course on filmmaking. During the
        1970s-1990s, Freewater's Production Coordinator organized a weekly film workshop geared
        toward beginning and intermediate filmmakers at Duke, focusing on techniques such as
        animation and graphics. Initially, the organization only had the equipment to produce and
        process 16mm black and white film, and did most of the processing tasks in-house, in the
        basement of the Old Chemistry Building on Duke's West Campus. Prints of student-made films
        were often shown during film series held at Duke and at national screenings; additionally,
        monitors in the Flowers Lounge often showed some of the films. </p>
      <p>Freewater also provided use of their equipment for projects by the Duke Hospital (for
        producing a commercial) and the Anthropology Department (for producing a documentary on
        primate research). In some Duke courses, students were allowed to produce films for academic
        credit; for example the 1982 course <emph render="doublequote">Politics and the Media</emph>
        allowed students to incorporate original film-making projects. Other Freewater projects
        included documentaries on Duke professors, North Carolina environmental issues, and
        political rallies in Washington, D.C. Many of the films present fictional narratives
        featuring scenes from Duke campus, including Perkins Library, the Duke Gardens, the Chapel,
        and the Duke Hospital.</p>
      <p>In the Spring of 1974, Freewater absorbed the videotape committee of the Union to
        coordinate expertise between tape and film experts; they continued to champion experiments
        with videotape as a new medium. Currently, it is divided into two separate committees:
        Freewater Productions and Freewater Presentations.</p>

                render="doublequote">The Freewater Film Society was given the task of restoring this
                film, transferring it from its original volatile, somewhat decayed nitrite stock to
                modern safety film. This was painstakingly done under the direction of David Young
                with the assistance of Valerie Gertner, Laura Hambleton, Avery Rimer, Jose Berger,
                and David Walder. An appropriate soundtrack, Lee Erwin playing music for D. W.
                Griffith classics on the Fox-Capitol Theatre Wurlitzer, has been added for the
                modern audience.</emph>

              <p>Synopsis from film: <emph render="doublequote">The filmed sequences you are about
                  to see were taken during the course of an eight-week pilot project conceived by
                  two Durham women, ex-teachers, who felt the necessity both to increase community
                  involvement in public education, and to seriously open for consideration the
                  necessity of making education in creative skills a primary aspect of elementary
                  education. The Education Committee of the First Presbyterian Church of Durham,
                  itself having been at work on the concept of arts education, sponsored the pilot
                  project.</emph></p>
