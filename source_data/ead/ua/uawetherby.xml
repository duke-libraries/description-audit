         <p>Wetherby was active in many professional organizations during his career, including the
            Speech Association of America, Educational Theatre Association (Honorary Life Member),
            Southern Speech Association, Delta Sigma Rho Tau Kappa Alpha, Sigma Alpha Eta (Speech
            and Hearing Honorary), American Forensic Association, North Carolina Speech Association
            (President), and Association of Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages.</p>

      <scopecontent id="aspace_fcec7c7034d7e1ee21d8664c3f2fca04">
         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Wetherby Papers contain printed material (including pamphlets, brochures, flyers,
            programs, speeches, and clippings), correspondence, minutes, memoranda, teaching aids
            and other teaching materials, student papers, photographs, research notes, writings, and
            other papers. Inclusive dates for the collection are ca. 1930 to 1976, with the bulk of
            material from 1947 to 1976.</p>
         <p> These papers chiefly reflect Wetherby's interest in three major areas: teaching English
            as a foreign language, broadcasting, and debating. In the first category falls material
            on grammar and enunciation (including numerous exercises, tests, and other teaching
            aids), speech and hearing pathology, and a small number of administrative papers dealing
            with the teaching of English to international students at Duke University. In the area
            of broadcasting, there are clippings, course descriptions, lecture material, and printed
            material on the history of radio and television; its methods, principles, and policies;
            legal status; government policies affecting broadcasting; and audience and market
            research. Wetherby also kept clippings, printed matter, and copies of speeches on
            communications and broadcasting in general, as well as on specialized topics such as TV
            violence and cigarette advertising. </p>
         <p> Files concerning the history of Duke University include materials on a proposed FM
            station for the campus (1957-1968), as well as selected student papers on such topics as
            broadcasting at Duke, the Vigil of 1968, and the Associated Students of Duke University
            in a conflict with WDBS. There are also a number of selected student papers on various
            aspects of communications, broadcasting, and the persuasive speaking. </p>
         <p> There is a card file on members of the Debate Team with their records by opponent and
            tournament, and a small amount of material (correspondence, records, circulars, a
            telegram) on the West Point National Tournament for 1962 to 1964. </p>
         <p> Useful information regarding a significant incident early in Wetherby's tenure as
            debate coach will be found in William King, <title type="simple" render="doublequote"
               >Not fit to debate? National debate topic on Communist China gets hackles up,</title>
            in the <title type="simple" render="italic">Duke Alumni Register</title>, vol. 65, no.
            2, Nov.- Dec. 1978. The article deals with Wetherby's defense of the right of collegiate
            debaters to argue this sensitive topic in 1954, at the height of the McCarthy era.
            Wetherby appeared on the <title type="simple" render="doublequote">See It Now</title>
            program of Edward R. Murrow on CBS Television. </p>
         <p>Wetherby coached three teams from Duke University which appeared on national television
            on the <title type="simple" render="doublequote">College Bowl</title> series, in 1955,
            1960, and 1968. Some materials in the collection deal with the logistics of these teams'
            travel and appearances, and on the operation of the telecasts. </p>
         <p> Gathered in separate folders as well as scattered throughout the collection is a large
            amount of printed material in the form of brochures, handbooks, pamphlets, newsletters,
            and copies of speeches. Included is material from organizations like the National
            Association of Broadcasters, the Federal Communications Commission, the Southern Speech
            Association (later the Southern Speech Communication Association), and the Speech
            Communication Association. The collection from the Southern Speech Association and its
            successor organization includes a consecutive run of programs for annual conventions
            from 1951 to 1976. The material on the Speech Communication Association includes
            consecutive issues from 1968 to 1976 of <title type="simple" render="italic">Free
               Speech</title>, a newsletter of this organization's Commission on Freedom of Speech. </p>
         <p>During the 1960s, Wetherby frequently was sent to regional high schools to promote Duke
            University to prospective students. </p>

                  <p>3 binders and 1 notebook contain notes on speech, persuasive speaking,
                     semantics, speech pathology; tests; syllabi; outlines of books; lessons; and
                     other papers. These are either lecture notes or class notes made by Wetherby as
                     a student.</p>
