            Women was founded in 1982 as a collaborative endeavor between Duke University and the
            University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to promote Women's Studies scholarship,
            research, and curriculum development in the South. The project was originally named the
            Duke-UNC Women's Studies Research Center, but changed its name to the Duke-UNC Center
            for Research on Women in 1987. The Center operated with support from the Ford Foundation
            and the Rockefeller Foundation, smaller grants from local foundations, and institutional
            backing from Duke and UNC. The records contain correspondence, reports, grant documents,
            audiotapes, a videotape, and other materials relating to the Center for Research on
            Women. Major subjects include women's studies curriculum development and research, pay
            equity, and the relationships between race, class, and gender. Materials range in date

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The Duke-UNC Center for Research on Women (CROW) was founded in 1982 as a collaborative
            endeavor between Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to
            promote Women's Studies scholarship, research, and curriculum development in the South.
            With support from the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation, smaller grants
            from local foundations, and institutional backing from both Duke and UNC-CH, the Center
            aimed to create a network among scholars and others in the region who were interested in
            the new scholarship on women.</p>
         <p> The Center's regular activities included a post-doctoral humanist-in-residence
            fellowship program; the publication of a working papers series: <title type="simple"
               render="italic">Southern Women: The Intersection of Race Class and Gender</title>, a
            joint effort with the Memphis State University Center for Research on Women; the
            publication of a biannual newsletter, <title type="simple" render="italic"
               >Branches</title>, which informed scholars and other interested individuals in the
            region about conferences, job opportunities, grants and the new scholarship on women;
            and a wide range of conferences, seminars and community events. </p>
         <p>The Center also sponsored statewide and regional conferences on topics such as Pay
            Equity in North Carolina, Women and Work in the South, and Dialogues Between Black and
            White Women. Other activities included high school and college curriculum transformation
            projects, including the Ford funded project, <title type="simple" render="doublequote"
               >Incorporating Women of Color Into the Undergraduate Curriculum</title>; women's
            studies summer institutes; the 1988 annual Southeastern Women's Studies Association
            (SEWSA) meeting; and the 1991 Southern Association of Women Historians Conference. From
            1985-1990 the Research Center was home to <title type="simple" render="italic">Signs: A
               Journal of Women in Culture and Society</title>, one of the leading feminist
            scholarly journals in the country. The central purpose of the Center was to underline
            the dynamics of gender, race, and class as central themes upon which to base
            understanding of women's and men's experiences in the South. </p>
         <p> The Center's Advisory Board included both Duke and UNC-CH faculty: Dorothy Browne
            (School of Public Health, UNC); William H. Chafe (History, Duke); Peter Filene (History,
            UNC); Barbara Harris (Women's Studies/History, UNC); Iris Hill ( Center for Documentary
            Studies, Duke); Soyini Madison (Speech Communications, UNC); Micheline Malson (Inst. for
            Public Policy, Duke); Jean O'Barr (Women's Studies, Duke); Margaret O'Connor (English,
            UNC); Angela O'Rand (Sociology, Duke); Naomi Quinn (Anthropology, Duke); Janice Radway
            (Literature, Duke); Anne Firor Scott (History, Duke); Jacquelyn Dowd Hall (History, UNC)
            was the Academic Director and Christina Greene was the Project Director. </p>
         <p> The Center's primary projects included: <list type="marked">
               <item>Curriculum Transformation: grants from the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller
                  Foundation to work with faculty in the region to create or revise courses in the
                  humanities and social sciences to reflect the new scholarship in women's studies
                  with particular attention to issues of race and class. The Center's first Ford
                  grant in 1982 provided support for the Duke and UNC-CH Women's Studies Program
                  Directors to develop the Introduction to Women's Studies Course on each campus. In
                  1989-1992, Ford funded the project <title type="simple" render="doublequote"
                     >Incorporating Women of Color Into the Undergraduate Curriculum</title> to work
                  with Duke and UNC-CH faculty in four target departments: History, English,
                  Sociology and Anthropology.</item>
               <item>Research: Ford provided funding in 1982 for 11 faculty and 28 graduate students
                  from Duke and UNC-CH whose work addressed the Center's focus on gender, race and
                  class.</item>
               <item>
                  <title type="simple" render="italic">Signs: A Journal of Women in Culture and
                     Society</title>: In 1985, the Center won a national competition to become the
                  host (1985-1991) to the leading scholarly feminist journal. Many of the Center's
                  Advisory Board members served as editors for the journal. </item>
               <item>Rockefeller Humanist-In-Residence Fellowship Program: From 1987-1992, the
                  Center received grants from the Rockefeller Foundation to bring scholars to the
                  Center for a year to work on a book-length manuscript on race, class, and gender.
                  These funds provided support for 11 scholars (mostly junior scholars), all of whom
                  were able to turn dissertations into books or make substantial progress on
                  completing a second book.</item>
               <item>What Difference Does Difference Make: The Politics of Race, Class, and Gender:
                  Ford and Rockefeller Foundation grants provided funds for a national conference to
                  explore the state of the current scholarship on diversity. The conference, held
                  May 1992, brought together scholars in women's, racial, ethnic and critical legal
                  studies to explore some of the current debates surrounding work on diversity,
                  including the controversies over "political correctness" and multiculturalism,
                  affirmative action and the Columbus quincentennial.</item>
               <item>Pay Equity in North Carolina: The Center received funding from the Z. Smith
                  Reynolds Foundation to promote pay equity (based on gender and race equity) in
                  North Carolina through a statewide conference and a pay equity study/project which
                  would serve as a model for similar efforts throughout the state. The Center
                  completed the second phase of the project in the fall of 1992, and Orange County
                  became the first public entity in North Carolina to conduct a pay equity study and
                  make pay adjustments in accordance with its findings.</item>
