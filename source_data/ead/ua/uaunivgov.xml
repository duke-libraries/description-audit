            Governance at Duke University was created in April 1969 by Chancellor pro tem Barnes
            Woodhall. The group was charged with studying changes in university organization
            nationwide to create a model for administration at Duke. The group also focused on
            increasing student participation in university governance. The records include minutes,
            memoranda, correspondence, and reports produced by the Commission on University
            Governance, as well as reports, clippings, and other printed matter gathered by the
            Commission for reference purposes. The Commission published its findings and
            recommendations in three "Interim Reports," concerning the Board of Trustees, the
            Central Administration, and Departmental Governance. English.</abstract>

         <p>Collection was 4.2 linear feet (7 Hollinger and 1 RS box) pre-processing. Primary
            actions taken include refoldering, weeding of duplicate materials, and establishing
            series arrangement. Forty 7" reel to reel audiotape recordings of the Commission's
            meetings were discarded, as typed transcriptions and/or detailed minutes were available
            for each of its 34 meetings. Also discarded was a 4-volume report to the British
            Parliament by the Prime Minister's Committee on Higher Education (Robbins Committee), as
            relevant portions were photocopied and retained with other reference files. Eleven
            volumes of The Study of Education at Stanford were discarded, while Volume X,
            "Government of the University," was retained. Student Perspective, 1964: The Student
            Philosophy and other Duke reports found in multiple University Archives collections were
            likewise discarded. A binder which included copies of Commission minutes and
            correspondence through the first 10 meetings, created to introduce new Duke President
            Terry Sanford to the Commission's purpose and actions, was discarded, as it duplicated
            exactly the material in folders for the first 10 meetings. However, the introduction to
            this volume, which provides a summary of the Commission's creation and Fall 1969
            activities, is filed in Box 1 under Correspondence - Miscellaneous. </p>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The late 1960s was a time of rapid change at American colleges and universities, as most
            experienced a surge of politicization by student activists; at Duke, this was most
            clearly exemplified in the Allen Building takeover of February 13, 1969. In response
            both to this local event and to national trends in higher education, the Faculty
            Committee on Student Concerns, the Executive Committee of the Academic Council, and the
            Student-Faculty-Administrative Council (SFAC) recommended the creation of a Commission
            on University Governance. In April 1969 Chancellor pro tem Barnes Woodhall appointed
            this committee, with the hopes that future demonstrations similar to the Allen Building
            takeover might be avoided if effective official opportunities for student participation
            in university governance could be established. The Commission on University Governance
            was therefore charged with the task of studying changes in university organization
            nationwide, focusing particularly on student participation in governance, and making
            recommendations for Duke accordingly. </p>
         <p> Members of the Commission eventually agreed that this purpose was best accomplished by
            dividing university governance into three categories: departmental governance, the
            central university administration, and the Board of Trustees. The latter body was
            already the subject of a study by a Board of Trustees Special Committee headed by
            Brantley Watson, and the Commission coordinated its efforts with the Watson Committee.
            The Commission on University Governance also worked simultaneously and cooperatively
            with the Chancellor's Advisory Committee, "The Committee of Twelve," which replaced the
            SFAC as the forum for airing Duke community grievances and which was meant to advise the
            administration concerning potentially volatile campus issues. The Commission on
            University Governance met 34 times between October 27, 1969 and May 17, 1970, at which
            time it adjourned for the school year and was never reactivated.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
         <p>The records of the Commission on University Governance span the years 1969 to 1971, with
            most of the material dating from 1969-1970 academic year. The collection is organized
            into two series: materials created by the Commission, and materials collected by the
            Commission.</p>
         <p>The records generated by the Commission on University Governance consist primarily of
            minutes and transcripts of its official meetings, including supplementary materials
            distributed for discussion at these meetings. Typed transcript drafts exist for meetings
            1 through 19, and this series contains minutes for all 34 meetings. Also included in
            this series are two copies of each of the Commission's three Interim Reports (Board of
            Trustees, Central Administration, and Departmental Governance), as well as drafts of
            these reports. Other official Commission records include information on the Commission's
            members and clippings from the <emph render="italic">Chronicle</emph>, <emph
               render="italic">Durham Morning Herald</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Durham
               Sun</emph> dated September 30, 1969 to April 16, 1970 concerning the work of the
            Commission. Correspondence not included with Commission minutes is divided into two
            folders: 1) letters dated April to September 1969, all regarding the establishment of
            the Commission, and 2) official correspondence dated after that time, including a
            January 1970 introduction to the Commission's activities for new Duke President Terry
            Sanford and a January 1971 response to the Commission's Interim Reports from the
            Provost.</p>
         <p>The Commission on University Governance amassed a significant collection of reference
            materials for use in formulating its reports, which are roughly arranged into subseries.
            It appears that members of the Commission twice attempted to catalog and collate these
            materials, as two indexes entitled "Materials on Hand" and "Table of Contents" are a
            part of this series. However, neither index is accompanied by a complete set of the
            materials listed on it. To preserve original order, the sections of listed materials
            that are present have been identified and retained, even when they duplicate each other.
            Printed matter that was not a part of either of these subseries falls into two
            categories: reports and other matter from Duke committees, schools, and organizations,
            and printed matter that was created by other universities and organizations. This series
            also contains several bibliographies, arranged both by subject and by format, as well as
            periodical abstracts, alphabetized by author, donated to the Commission from the Special
            Committee on Student Residential Life. Also present in this series are the complete
            minutes of the Chancellor's Advisory Committee, known as the Committee of Twelve, which
            met nineteen times between October 1969 and March 1970, when it was disbanded. </p>
         <p>University Archives also has catalogued copies of the Commission's three Interim
            Reports: <lb/>Board of Trustees - 378.756 D877CTR <lb/>Central Administration - 378.756
            D877CGO <lb/>Departmental Governance - 378.756 D877CDG </p>
