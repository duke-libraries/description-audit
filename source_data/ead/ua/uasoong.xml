      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Han Chiao-shun (Charles "Charlie" Jones Soong) was Trinity College's first international
        student. Born in the Wench'ang district of the island of Hainan, off the coast of the
        Kwangtung province of China in 1866, he was the youngest of three boys. Around 1875, he was
        sent off to the East Indies with one of his brothers to find work. Three years later he was
        adopted by a childless maternal uncle and taken to the United States where his name was
        changed to Soon Chai-Jui.</p>
      <p>Upon arriving in the United States, the young Soong worked in his uncle's tea and silk shop
        in Boston. He then became a cabin boy in the Coast Guard where he met Captain Eric
        Gabrielson. Gabrielson, a devout Methodist, talked to Song about Christianity and took him
        to church whenever they were in port. On November 7, 1880 Charles Jones Soon (the final "g"
        was not added until his return to China in 1886) was baptized at the Fifth Street Methodist
        Church in Wilmington, North Carolina. </p>
      <p>Soong, who had expressed interest in securing an education and returning to China as a
        missionary, received aid from General Julian S. Carr of Durham who financed his education at
        Trinity College, Duke University's forerunner. Soong spent close to two years (April
        1881-fall 1882) at Trinity as a "special and preparatory student" where he studied under Dr.
        Braxton Craven, Trinity's president. In the fall of 1882 he entered the theological seminary
        of Vanderbilt University. </p>
      <p>In January 1886, Soong arrived in Shanghai as a missionary under the auspices of the North
        Carolina Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church (South). Soong continued to
        serve as a missionary until 1892 when he resigned and went into private enterprise.
        Although, no longer a missionary Soong continued to be a "devout and active Christian"
        founding the YMCA in China, working with the American Bible Society in Shanghai, teaching
        Sunday school classes, and providing generous financial support.</p>
      <p>In addition to being a lay leader and a businessman, Charles Jones Soong and his family are
        often regarded as "republican China's first family." Although the exact extents of his
        participation in the revolutionary movement are undocumented, he was known to be an ardent
        supporter and close friend of Sun Yat-sen. His daughter Ch'ing-ling married Sun Yat-sen. His
        remaining children (all educated in the United States) continued to play a role in Chinese
        history. One daughter married Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek. The third daughter married
        the Chinese finance minister (said to be the richest man in the world). One of Soong's sons
        became the Chinese prime minister, another was chairman of the bank of Canton, and the third
        became an international financier. </p>
