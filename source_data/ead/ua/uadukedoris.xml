         <abstract id="aspace_0e2e729424e1d8ece626817889de2ed8">Born on November 22, 1912, Doris
            Duke was the only child of James Buchanan (J.B.) Duke, a founder of the American Tobacco
            Company and Duke Energy Company and a benefactor of Duke University, and Nanaline Holt
            Duke. Inheriting a bulk of her father's estate in 1925, which included Duke Farms in New
            Jersey, Rough Point in Newport, R.I., and a mansion in New York City, Doris was soon
            dubbed by the press as "the richest girl in the world." Although Doris did her best to
            live a private life, she contributed to a number of public causes and was an active
            supporter of the arts, historic preservation, and the environment. Doris Duke died in
            October 1993 at the age of 80. In her will she left the majority of her estate to the
            Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. The Doris Duke Papers were created by combining
            materials maintained by staff at the Duke Business Office and/or household staff of the
            Main Residence, on Doris Duke's behalf. It mostly contains the personal papers generated
            by or about Doris Duke throughout her lifetime. The collection covers the period 1798 to
            2003, although the majority of the collection is concentrated in the 1930s to 1993. The
            collection is organized into 9 series limited to Doris Duke's personal relationships,
            dealings, and interests: Administrative Records, Personal Correspondence, Financial
            Records, Legal Records, Reports and Summaries, Subject Files, and Duke Business Office
            Safe.</abstract>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>Born on November 22, 1912, Doris Duke was the only child of James Buchanan (J.B.) Duke,
            a founder of the American Tobacco Company and Duke Energy Company and a benefactor of
            Duke University, and Nanaline Holt Duke. Inheriting a bulk of her father's estate in
            1925, which included Duke Farms in New Jersey, Rough Point in Newport, R.I., and a
            mansion in New York City, Doris was soon dubbed by the press as "the richest girl in the
            world." Although Doris did her best to live a private life, she carried on the Duke
            family's pattern of philanthropy by contributing to a number of public causes such as
            the arts, historic preservation, and the environment. When she was 21 she established
            Independent Aid, a foundation which would later became the Doris Duke Foundation.
            Adventurous, intelligent and independent, Doris Duke was determined not to be defined by
            social expectations or her vast wealth. She traveled widely and pursued her many
            interests including music, dance, writing, and art. Doris Duke was married twice, first
            to James H.R. Cromwell and then to Porfirio Rubirosa. Both marriages ended in divorce.
            Doris Duke died in October 1993 at the age of 80. In her will she left the majority of
            her estate to the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Doris Duke papers (formerly MSS.001) is part of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation
            Historical Archives which were donated to the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp;
            Manuscript Library by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. The collection is artificial
            in nature, created by combining materials maintained by staff at the Duke Business
            Office and/or household staff of the Main Residence, on Doris Duke's behalf. It mostly
            contains the personal papers generated by or about Doris Duke throughout her lifetime.
            Since Doris Duke's staff maintained her professional and personal records, often in the
            same filing structures, materials regarding her personal life were intermingled
            throughtout the larger collection. In order to improve access to important documents,
            all materials of a personal nature were selected out and incorporated into this
            collection. The only major exception is Series VII: Duke Business Office Safe, where the
            personal and professional contents of the office are maintained together to preserve the
            integrity of the materials and serve as a testament to business operations.</p>
         <p>The Doris Duke Papers covers the period 1798 to 2003, although the majority of the
            collection is concentrated in the 1930s to 1993. The collection is divided into 7 series
            limited to Doris Duke's personal relationships, dealings, and interests: Administrative
            Records, Personal Correspondence <emph render="bold">(RESTRICTED)</emph>, Financial
            Records, Legal Records, Reports and Summaries, Subject Files, and Duke Business Office
            Safe.</p>

               <p>This series contains an assortment of materials related to the broad and varied
                  business and personal activities of Doris Duke. Materials related to business
                  activities include correspondence, agendas, reports, and minutes from Doris Duke's
                  business team. Topics range from investments, new ventures (including the
                  chartering of the Newport Restoration Foundation), and loans, to job descriptions,
                  stock donations, approval of gifts (donations), and information on the General
                  Charitable Aid Association. Other business related materials include activity
                  reports, repairs to homes, design proposals, NRF work progress reports, and
                  requests for interviews. While these materials are related to Doris Duke's
                  business pursuits, the personal side of life is also reflected as the authors
                  often comment on current events and other daily activities such as congratulations
                  on her marriage to Porfirio Rubirosa.</p>
               <p>Materials related to the personal activities of Doris Duke include invitations to
                  a variety of charitable events, solicitations for charitable contributions
                  (letters addressed directly to Doris Duke and not her charitable organization
                  often from individuals not personally acquainted with her), datebooks, address
                  books, personal letters to friends (copies), magazine subscriptions, and
                  correpondence related to travel. Of particular interest is correspondence
                  (letters, telegrams) between Doris Duke and her mother Nanaline and between Doris
                  Duke and her half-brother Walker Inman Sr. (Miss Duke signed her letters "Sis"),
                  and two letters from Doris Duke while on her honeymoon in 1935.</p>
               <p>The materials are loosely arranged in chronological order. Note that the subseries
                  contains several documents written in French and Italian with no translation.</p>
               <p>This series also contains electronic records related to a variety of
                  administrative activities at the Duke Farms residence and includes monthly reports
                  from managers, summaries of correspondence generated by the Duke Business Office
                  staff, telephone messages, and lists of request for donations from the Doris Duke
                  Foundation. The Duke Business Office arranged the electronic records in folders by
                  both subject and by month and year.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
               <p>A majority of the correspondence in this series are written to Doris Duke by a
                  variety of family, friends, and acquaintances. Materials include letters,
                  telegrams, cards, notes, and postcards. Of particular interest are outgoing
                  letters from Doris Duke to Marian Paschal while she was an International News
                  Service (INS) correspondent during World War II. These letters give insight to
                  Doris Duke's experiences while overseas.</p>
               <p>A majority of the series is arranged alphabetically by sender. The last box in the
                  series contains general correspondence in which senders could not be identfied
                  and/or letters that may or may not attest to a deeper relationship with Doris
                  Duke. Note that the subseries contains letters written in French and Italian with
                  very few translations.</p>

                  <p>This series illustrates the broad, diverse financial activities of Doris Duke,
                     and covers a variety of personal and business related topics. Materials include
                     letters to Doris Duke thanking her for generous donations (personal donations,
                     not through her Foundation), estimates for Shangri La by the Hawaiian
                     Contracting Company Ltd, invoices for furniture and other purchases at
                     Parke-Bernet, personal expenses such as clothing, hair, repairs to residences,
                     rental of a Lear Jet, and transportation of swans and camels from New Jersey to
                     Newport (and the other way around). Also included in this series are Doris
                     Duke's personal tax returns (with supporting documentation of donations given
                     for the year, journal entries, and "work papers"), stock and bond advice,
                     personal bank and credit card statements and annual reports on Doris Duke's net
                     worth. Of particular interest is correspondence related to Doris Duke
                     Cromwell's financial assistance to Miss Ruby Roney and Mildred Brett, distant
                     Duke family members.</p>

                  <p>The Black Books were maintained by the Duke Business Office staff to inventory
                     and track the movement of objects on and between Doris Duke’s properties. The
                     books contain photographs and provenance information (when known) of almost
                     every object owned by Doris Duke. Many of the books include paper inventories
                     and miscellaneous notes about the objects. These Books are numbered in the
                     order in which they were found and processed.</p>

                  <p>This subseries primarily consists of inventory cards either in binders (books)
                     or unbound and were maintained by the Duke Business Office staff, circa
                     1970s–1990s, to inventory and track the movement of objects on and between
                     Doris Duke’s properties. These cards have been left in the original order they
                     were found and presumably created in. For the most part, they are arranged by
                     location and room thereunder, except as noted below. Also in this subseries are
                     invoices (copies &amp; originals) from art and antique dealers documenting the
                     purchase of art, furniture and other objects from the 1930s to the 1960s, and
                     miscellenous correspondence and inventories from the various residences.</p>
                  <p>Inventory books 1-47 are arranged by location and room thereunder. Books 48-59
                     have been arranged by medium and location thereunder. Unbound inventory cards
                     have been kept in the original order they were found and presumably created in.
                     As such, they have been arranged by location and room thereunder. The unbound
                     Shangri La inventory cards were not stored with the other inventory cards but
                     were included in this subseries as they compliment the rest of the Shangri La
                     inventory cards.</p>

                  <p>During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Animal Medical Center (AMC) had a
                     research center on the Duke Farms estate to study the aging in large animals.
                     Doris Duke not only provided grants to the Animal Medical Center (via the Doris
                     Duke Foundation), but also leased pastures and barns on the property of Duke
                     Farms for a cattle center. The relationship with the AMC ended in 1974. This
                     materials in this subseries include annual reports, leases, and correspondence
                     and memoranda related to various subject matters of the Animal Medical Center

                  <p>The General Charitable Aid Association was a membership association of which
                     Doris Duke was a member. Nanaline Duke and Walker P. Inman, Sr. were also
                     members. Doris Duke contributed a monthly sum to the association which often
                     included a list of those individuals whom she felt were considered "worthy and
                     deserving of assistance." The materials include correspondence such as
                     charitable requests, charitable support and thank you letters from those
                     receiving assistance, annual reports of contributions and donations, and an
                     account book for all those receiving aid from the charitable association.</p>

                  <p>Doris Duke was an International News Service (INS) staff correspondent during
                     World War II and was primarily stationed in Italy. A majority of the materials
                     in this subseries are articles written by Doris Duke exclusively for the INS
                     while in Italy. She wrote dispatches from different parts of Italy including
                     Rome, Milan, Ischia, Trieste, Linz, and Gorizia. Photocopies of these articles
                     are included with the originals. Also included in this subseries is
                     correspondence and agreements related to Doris Duke's financial backing of The
                     American Publishing Co., Inc. and indentification documents carried by Doris
                     Duke. Of particular interest is a letter from Doris Duke to "Tom" regarding

                  <p>JODO Inc. was a recording company founded by Doris Duke in August, 1964 to
                     produce records. It attracted a few well known recording artists such as Kitty
                     White and Anita O'Day. JODO dissolved in 1966 and became Clover Enterprises,
                     Inc. The materials in this subseries document the daily activities of
                     establishing and running a "budding" record company, and include artist
                     recording agreements, invoices, requests for funds, promissory notes, and
                     business correspondence. Of particular interest are the reports about the music
                     industry which were provided by Peter Brook.</p>

                  <p>Doris Duke was the sole proprietor of LADD Interiors, a proprietorship with the
                     purpose of purchasing home furnishings and some antique furniture and then
                     transferring these goods to her for use in her own personal residence(s) or as
                     she desired. The first purchase by LADD was in 1972, and with few exceptions
                     all purchases by LADD were made in connection with refurbishing Doris Duke's
                     residences at Duke Farms, Rough Point, Shangri La and her Park Avenue
                     apartment. Materials in this subseries primarily consist of invoices and
                     correspondence for these purchases and for the restoration of some furniture.
                     Other materials include tax documentation, inventories (including color
                     photographs), bank statements and fabric samples.</p>

                  <p>The materials in this subseries vary widely and serve to document general
                     subjects related to Doris Duke that are not documented in the other subseries.
                     It is the only subseries that includes materials from Doris Duke's childhood
                     such as her school composition books, homework assignments, and glossy
                     photographs/scrapbooks of magazine clippings of actors and actresses from the
                     1920s. Other materials included are notes and lyrics written by Doris Duke,
                     original dress designs from the House of Paquin for Doris Duke, Playbills from
                     shows attended by Doris Duke, and newspaper clippings organized by Doris Duke
                     that were of interest to her. Inside these folders are the spines of the
                     binders (paper) with her handwriting on how they were separated. Of interest is
                     the "Me" binder (folder) which contains clippings about Doris Duke.</p>

                  <p>The correspondence in this subseries is general in nature primarily written by
                     those who were not close, personal friends of Doris Duke. There are a variety
                     of authors, including business associates, acquaintances and the general
                     public, who wrote on a wide range of topics including birthday greetings, thank
                     you letters/cards, requests for donations, invitations, requests for interviews
                     and general correspondence. In addition, Box 378 contains letters, memoranda,
                     notes, and business cards from either published authors or friends and
                     acquaintances which accompanied books personally sent Doris Duke. The
                     associated books, along with others without enclosed materials, have been
                     separated from the Doris Duke Papers and catalogued as part of the Rubenstein
                     Library's printed holdings.</p>

                  <p>This subseries contains a variety of administrative, financial, legal,
                     memorabilia and other personal materials that were located in Miss Duke's
                     office. Topics widely vary including materials related to charitable donations,
                     Doris Duke's 1938 trip to the Middle East, art and furniture purchases,
                     societies and clubs Doris Duke belonged to, and updates about Duke Farms while
                     Doris Duke was in Reno, NV. Of particular interest is the correspondence
                     written during World War II. Topics include Doris Duke's whereabouts during the
                     war, evacuation of English children, and news of what was happening at Miss
                     Duke's different estates during the war.</p>

                     animals including dogs, birds, camels, horses, and a donkey - and the materials
                     in this subseries document this aspect of her life. Materials include purchase
                     of pets, wild animals that were cared for at the different estates, the care of
                     different animals, vet bills and reports, and insurance for pets. Of particular
                     interest are the materials associated with the purchase and care of two

                     underpriviledged children. Miss Duke funded most of the original buildings and
                     over the course of several decades, generously donated to the camp for its
                     operations. The materials in this subseries document Doris Duke's role in the

                  <p>Walker P. Inman Jr. was the son of Walker P. Inman, Sr. (Doris Duke's step
                     brother) and Georgia Inman. After the death of his parents and after an initial
                     guardianship with a relative, Doris Duke was appointed the guardian of Walker
                     ("Skipper") in 1965. The materials in this subseries primarily focus on this
                     guardianship, and include correspondence, memoranda, and expenses related to
                     Walker Jr.'s schooling and upbringing, financial statements related to his
                     trusts, and legal documentation associated with the guardianship. Several of
                     the folders related to Walker P. Inman Jr.'s emotional, mental, and educational
                     progress are restricted.</p>

               <p>This series contains administrative, financial, legal, reports and summaries, and
                  other materials as maintained by the Duke Business Office. Although these
                  materials pertain mostly to Doris Duke and were acquired during her lifetime, some
                  of them were acquired before and after her lifetime. Topics include materials
                  relating to routine business matters, personal finances and accounts, travel,
                  divorces from James Cromwell and Porfirio Rubirosa, inventories of all belongings,
                  and deeds and titles to all properties owned. Of particular interest are Doris
                  Duke's passports which illustrate the numerous places Doris Duke visited during
                  her adult life.</p>
