      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>History adopted from Duke Chapel website: http://www.chapel.duke.edu/home/.</p>
      <p>When James B. Duke selected the site for Duke University's West Campus, in 1925, he chose
        to locate the Chapel on the site's highest ridge. The Chapel was the first building planned
        for the new campus, but the last one to be completed. Construction started in 1930, was
        completed in 1935, and cost nearly $2.3 million. The Chapel began to be used before its
        stained-glass windows and other details were finished; commencement was held in the Chapel
        in 1932. The Chapel was officially dedicated in 1935.</p>
      <p>The Chapel fulfills James B. Duke's desire that the building exert a profound influence on
        the lives of the young women and men who attend the University. Duke Chapel is a nationally
        recognized pulpit, an acclaimed center of sacred music, and a place of learning and
        interfaith cooperation. Duke University Chapel's ever-widening ministry includes worship
        through prayer, word, and music; service within the University and community; celebration
        through concerts, special services, and festivals; and learning seminars, study groups, and
        retreats. The day-to-day ministry of the Chapel is shared with a wide and diverse community:
        students, faculty, staff, and the community; tourists and travelers; and patients, their
        families, and caregivers. Chapel life encompasses a variety of groups including Religious
        Life, Friends of the Chapel, Congregation, and Student Ministry. Duke Chapel is also the
        site of various concerts, voice and organ recitals, choir and carillon programs, and vesper
        ensembles.</p>
