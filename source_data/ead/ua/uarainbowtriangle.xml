        Project was originally conceived in 1996 as a way to document the lives of LGBT (Lesbian,
        Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender) people in the Triangle region in particular and central
        North Carolina in general. Ian Lekus became the Project Coordinator in 1996 and worked with
        a varying group of volunteers to acquire resources, conduct interviews, and ensure the
        preservation and access of the oral histories collected. More than 60 interviews were
        conducted between 1999 and 2004. The Rainbow Triangle Oral History Collection includes
        original oral history recordings, transcripts, biographical information on narrators,
        newsclippings, correspondence, and research materials.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>The Rainbow Triangle Oral History Project was originally conceived in 1996, by
        then-Director of Duke's Center for Lesbian, Gay &amp; Bisexual Life (later the Center for
        Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Life, now the Center for Sexual and Gender
        Diversity) John Howard, who suggested the project to Ian Lekus, then a Ph.D. candidate in
        the Department of History and a member of the Duke University Task Force for Lesbian, Gay,
        and Bisexual Matters. </p>
      <p>The project was envisioned as a way to document the lives of LGBT people in the Triangle
        region in particular and central North Carolina in general, with the additional goals of
        exploring the idea of community identities and formation, breaking down barriers between the
        University and the local community, and documenting the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Triangle. </p>
      <p>Lekus became the Project Coordinator in 1996 and worked with a varying group of volunteers
        to acquire resources, conduct interviews, and ensure the preservation and access of the oral
        histories collected. From 1996 to late 1997, Lekus worked with others at Duke and elsewhere
        to develop forms and processes, conduct training workshops for interviewers, and establish
        how interviewes would be used and preserved. Anne Valk, a visiting professor at Duke, and
        Patrick Toal and Parker Doig, graduate students at the University of North Carolina at
        Chapel Hill, were other active project leaders at this time. In February 1998, the project
        was officially launched during a talk by author and activist Mab Segrest on the Duke campus,
        but the first group of interviews were conducted in late 1998 and early 1999.</p>
      <p>Dr. Karen Krahulik became the Director of the Center for LGBT Life in 1999 and continued
        support for the project. In Fall 2000, Dr. Krahulik and Ian Lekus co-taught a class called
        American Communities: Gender, Sexuality, and Oral History, presented by the Women's Studies
        Program and the History Department, and sponsored by the Center for Documentary Studies. As
        part of this class, students conducted oral history interviews that focused on gender and
        sexuality in the lives of the narrators, and several of these interviews were conducted as
        part of the Rainbow Triangle project. Ian Lekus taught this class again in 2004, and
        additional interviews from this class became part of the project.</p>
      <p>Narrators are generally residents of the Triangle region, many of them with a connection to
        Duke or Durham in particular. Narrators include both LGBT people and heterosexual people who
        have been involved in LGBT issues in some way. Interviewers include Duke staff or volunteers
        for the Center for LGBT Life, Duke students, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
        students, and others.</p>

      <p>The Rainbow Triangle Oral History Collection includes original oral history recordings,
        transcripts, biographical information on narrators, newsclippings, correspondence, and
        research materials. Oral history interviews are primarily sound recordings, covering a wide
        range of topics including the narrators' early lives, families and family relationships,
        education, social life, experience of their own sexual identity, experience in or work with
        the LGBT community (in the Triangle and elsewhere), activism, working lives, romantic
        partners, professional activities, and many other topics. Original recordings are primarily
        on audiocassette tapes. About half of the oral histories also include printed transcripts. A
        few oral histories also include additional biographical information about the narrator, much
        of it included on an information sheet created by the Rainbow Triangle project, but
        sometimes also including additional material such as news articles, correspondence, flyers,
        and other items. Also included are materials related to the planning and development of the
        project, including correspondence, drafts, notes, and background research into LGBT life in
        the Triangle and oral history as a documentary form, as well as several years worth of the
        Pink Triangle issue of the local Independent Weekly.</p>

          <p>This series includes original recordings of oral history interviews with narrators in
            the Rainbow Triangle Project. The majority of recordings are on audiocassette tapes,
            with a few video recordings on tapes. About half of the interviews include a printed
            transcript, some of which are incomplete; these transcripts were generally created by
            the interviewer. Many interviews also include completed biographical information sheets,
            created by the Project and completed by the narrator around the time of the interview.
            These forms may include information on the narrator's early life, education, work, civic
            activities, and other biographical topics. Some files also include additional materials,
            including correspondence, news articles, flyers, and publications. Many of these
            interviews were conducted by Duke students as part of the Duke undergraduate class
            American Communities: Gender, Sexuality, and Oral History in 2000 and 2004; two of the
            files include papers written by the student interviewers about the narrators with whom
            they worked.</p>
