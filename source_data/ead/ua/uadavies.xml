      <p>W. D. (William David) Davies was born in Carmarthenshire, Wales, United Kingdom, and
        educated at the University of Wales (B.A.from Cardiff, 1934; B.D. from Breccon, 1938) and
        Cambridge University (B.A. 1940, M.A. 1942). Davies received his doctorate (D.D. operis
        causa 1948) from the University of Wales. </p>
      <p>In 1941, Davies was ordained into the Congregational Church at Fowlmere, England. He taught
        at Yorkshire United College, Bradford, Yorkshire, from 1946 to 1950 before moving to Duke
        for five years as a professor of Biblical theology (1950 to 1955). From 1955 through 1959 he
        was professor of religion at Princeton University, where he helped start the graduate
        program in Religion. He was then appointed Edward Robinson Professor of Biblical Theology at
        Union Theological Seminary in New York, as well as adjunct professor at Columbia University,
        from 1959 to 1966. He rejoined the Duke faculty in 1966 as George Washington Ivey Professor
        of Advanced Studies and Research in Christian Origins. He stayed until his retirement in
        1981. He then became the Bradford Professor at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth,
        Texas and in 1986-87 he was a Fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge, UK. He also taught at the
        University of California at Berkeley (1971-1972) and at the University of Strasboroug,
        France (1973-1974).</p>
      <p>Davies held numerous fellowships and received several awards and honors. He was a Fellow of
        the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy,
        (from which he also received the Burkitt Medal in Biblical Studies in 1965), an Honorary
        Fellow of Cambridge University's Fitzwilliam College, a Fellow of the Bellagio Center,
        Italy, and Fellow of the American Academy of Jewish Research. He was a recipient of two
        Guggenheim Fellowships and received honorary doctorates from the University of St. Andrews,
        the Pacific School of Religion, Uppsala University and the University of Wales, the latter
        being an honorary doctorate in literature. Davies also served as honorary president of the
        Society for Biblical Literature and President of the Society of New Testament Studies
        (1976), which met in the United States for the first time that year at Duke University. He
        was a member of the executive committee of the World Congress of Jewish Studies, Jerusalem
        (1965). </p>
      <p>Among his published works are the <title render="italic">Paul and Rabbinic Judaism</title>
        (1948), the <title render="italic">The Setting of the Sermon on the Mount</title> (1966),
        and the <title render="italic">The Gospel and the Land: Early Christianity and Jewish
