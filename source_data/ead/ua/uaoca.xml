            Cultural Affairs was created in 1969 as part of the Division of Student Affairs and
            existed until 1993, when, as part of a reorganization of the Division, it was superceded
            by the Office of University Life. The Office of Cultural Affairs Records, 1931-2002
            (bulk 1958-2002), consist of budgets and financial reports; calendars; contracts;
            correspondence; meeting minutes; printed materials; black-and-white, color, and 35mm
            photographs; and videocassettes, audiocassettes, and digital audio tapes. Materials
            primarily span the years of the OCA's official existence, 1969-1993, but also contain
            earlier materials about its first director, Ella Fountain Pratt, and later records
            created by the Office of University Life. Arranged in five series: Subject Files, which
            provide a broad overview of the OCA's activities, including early correspondence between
            Duke University and the American Dance Festival, which moved to Duke in 1977; the
            Chamber Arts Society, a group that promoted chamber music performance in Durham and
            surrounding areas; the Duke Artists Series, a concert series that began in 1930 and came
            under the oversight of OCA upon its creation in 1969; the Summer Session, programming
            for which also became one of the OCA's primary responsibilities; and the Triangle Dance
            Guild, a group independent of Duke that coordinated with the OCA to promote dance
            performance on campus and in Durham and surrounding areas from 1976-1984.</abstract>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The Duke University Office of Cultural Affairs was created in 1969 as part of the
            Division of Student Affairs and directed by Ella Fountain Pratt from its inception until
            1984. Pratt was succeeded by Susan L. Cook, who served as Director until 1993, when the
            Office was superceded by the Office of University Life as part of a reorganization of
            the Division.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Office of Cultural Affairs Records, 1931-2002 (bulk
               1958-2002)</emph>, consist of budgets and financial reports, calendars, contracts,
            correspondence, meeting minutes, photographs, and printed materials that document the
            Office's administration and scheduling of concerts and other performing arts events,
            arts festivals, and certain performance venues and buildings on the campus of Duke
            University. The majority of these records span the years of the OCA's official
            existence, 1969-1993; but there are also older materials that stem from the earlier Duke
            career of the OCA's initial director, Ella Fountain Pratt, as well as later records
            created under the Office of University Life, which superceded the OCA in 1993.
            Audiovisual material in the collection include more than 500 black-and-white, color, and
            35mm photographs; additionally, there are several videocassettes, audiocassettes, and
            digital audio tapes. The collection is arranged in five series beginning with the most
            general, Subject Files, followed in alphabetical order by four smaller and more specific
            series that document the history of various concert series or arts organizations. </p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Subject Files</emph> are not only the largest series but also
            give the broadest overview of the OCA's activities. Several large folder groups exist
            within the series, including one that contains early correspondence and negotiations
            between Duke University and the American Dance Festival, which moved to Duke in 1977.
            The series also contains correspondence and other records that span Pratt's entire
            career at Duke, from the late 1950s through her retirement in 1984. The next four series
            document the history of various concert series or artistic groups that were either
            administrated by or collaborated with the OCA. The first and largest of these series is
            the <emph render="bold">Chamber Arts Society. </emph> Founded in 1945 to promote chamber
            music performance in Durham , this group eventually came under the aegis of Duke
            University and the Office of Cultural Affairs in 1975. Although files here tell a little
            of that early history, they primarily document some fifteen years of concerts on campus
            from the mid-1980s through 2002. Following this are the records of the <emph
               render="bold">Duke Artists Series</emph>, a concert series that began in 1930. When
            the OCA was created in 1969, management and oversight of the Duke Artists Series was
            made one of its primary responsibilities. The files here mainly document several seasons
            of concerts in the late 1980s and late 1990s. Much like the Duke Artists Series,
            cultural programming for the University's <emph render="bold">Summer Session
               Series</emph> also became a primary responsibility of the OCA upon its creation. This
            series covers more than forty years of summer session history, including programming
            that continued under the Office of University Life. The final series contains the
            history of the <emph render="bold">Triangle Dance Guild.</emph> Independent of Duke,
            this group existed from 1976-1984 and coordinated with the OCA to promote dance
            performance on campus and in Durham and other local venues.</p>

                  wide variety of individual files, four larger folder groups in the series document
                  the following subjects in greater detail: Ella Fountain Pratt's work on the
                  exective board of the Association of College, University and Community Arts
                  Administrators (ACUCAA); recruitment of the American Dance Festival (ADF) to Duke
                  in the 1970s; history of the usage, maintenance, and physical improvements made to
                  Page Auditorium; and records of the first fifteen years of the Mary Lou Williams
                  Jazz Festival (1983-1998). In various files the series also contains information
                  spanning most of the career of Ella Fountain Pratt at Duke University; more
