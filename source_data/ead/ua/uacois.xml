         <head>Historical note</head>
         <p>Various sources of external support fitted together Duke University’s mosaic of programs
            in international studies in the two decades between 1955 and 1978. In 1955 a group of
            research scholars concerned with the British Commonwealth negotiated a $350,000 grant
            from the Carnegie-Commonwealth Fund, initiating a structured program of conferences,
            lectures, research, publications, and fellowships. In the 1960's United States
            educational institutions and the foundations that supported them were affected by a wave
            of interest in international studies as the nation looked outward with a mixture of
            interest, altruism, and fear for the first time since World War II.</p>
         <p>The first major grant to Duke from the Ford Foundation, made in 1961, was a development
            grant of $400,000 which allowed the expansion and intensification of international
            programs. This was followed by a five-year, $900,000 grant in 1964 allocated to
            international programs at Duke University. This led to the establishment of the
            Committee on International Studies. The committee was a part of the Provost's office,
            coordinating and advising the provost in the establishment of budgets for individual
            department programs. Vice-Provost Crauford Goodwin was instrumental in helping secure
            the major Ford grant for the program, and became the chairman and director of the
            Committee on International Studies from its inception in 1964 to the spring of 1971,
            when he took leave from Duke University to work for the Ford Foundation to direct their
            program on International Studies. The chairmanship then passed temporarily to Dr.
            Margaret Ball as acting chair, then to Dr. Thomas F. Keller, who chaired the Committee
            from the fall of 1971 to the spring of 1972. Dr. Ball then took the permanent
            chairmanship of the committee until the spring of 1974, after which it passed to Dr.
            Gerald Hartwig, who was acting director until the record series ends in 1978. Marion
            Salinger was the administrative assistant for the committee for the duration of its
            recorded existence.</p>
         <p>From the mid-1960s to the early 1970s the grant supported faculty and visiting faculty
            additions which brought scholars to the university with a variety of international
            interests and substantially strengthened the disciplines of history, economics,
            education, anthropology, sociology, religion, political science, and foreign languages.
            Due to the Ford Foundation grant Duke began offering instruction in non-western
            languages: Swahili, Hindi, Japanese, and Chinese, along with the necessary library staff
            support.</p>
         <p>The years of 1965 through 1973 saw a massive expansion in programs in international
            studies, as well as new sources of funding to supplement the Ford grant. The Ford
            Foundation gave an additional $400,000 for a two year cooperative (Duke-UNC)
            post-doctoral training program for faculty from regional colleges and universities; the
            South Asia committee was designated an N.D.E.A. program and received financial support
            from the U.S. Office of Education direct support for administration, faculty, and
            library staff, as well as 45 fellowships. Faculty research interest was also widely
            supported, in part by a grant by the Rockefeller foundation and research areas ranged
            around the globe--from an examination of forestry schools in Europe to a study on
            resistance to change in Rhodesia.</p>
         <p>With the advent of the 1970s, however, interests in area programs faded. The Ford
            Foundation grants ran out and were not renewed. Federal funding diminished, and the
            foundations withdrew support. Fellowship aid became scarce and program money was cobbled
            together largely through the individual efforts of faculty pursuing their own research.
            Interdisciplinary studies became the new vogue, while area studies faded and closed.
            Funding and interest shifted, but many of the programs and courses established with the
            seed money from the Ford Foundation and others became permanent parts of the Duke
            curriculum and remain active to this day. The Committee on International Studies
            survives today as the Office of International Affairs and Development, re-established in
            1995 as an adjunct of the Provost's Office. The office is dedicated to support the
            University's commitment to internationalization and provide a locus for new initiatives,
            as well as provide development activities for this specific purpose as well as for
            University initiatives as a whole, and carries on the legacy of Duke’s commitment to the
            support of international studies to this day.</p>
