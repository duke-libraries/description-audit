      <head>Biographical and Historical Note</head>
      <p>August Kenneth Pye (1931-1994) was twice Chancellor of Duke University (1970-1971 and
        1976-1982). Educated at the University of Buffalo (B.A., 1951) and Georgetown University
        (J.D., 1953, LL.M., 1955), Pye held the positions of professor and associate dean at the
        Georgetown University Law Center, 1955-1966. Pye held a number of positions at Duke. In
        addition to the chancellorship, he was Dean of the School of Law (1968-1970), University
        Counsel (1971-1974), Acting Dean of the School of Law (1973), Dean of the School of Law
        (1973-1977), Director of the Center for International Studies (1982-1984), and Samuel Fox
        Mordecai Professor of Law (1982-1987). Upon leaving Duke University, Pye held the positions
        of President and Professor of Law at Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas
        (1987-1994).</p>
      <p> President Emeritus R.L. Flowers was named Chancellor in 1949. The position was seemingly
        an honorary one, and there are no records of his tenure. The office was re-established in
        March 1969, when President Douglas M. Knight wanted an officer to assist with an increasing
        executive workload. The Chancellor was given responsibility for the internal operation of
        the University. Under the University By-Laws of May 10, 1988, the Chancellor was an
        executive officer with powers and duties assigned by the President. The occupants of the
        office have been Robert L. Flowers (1949-1951), Barnes Woodhall (1969-1970) (pro tem), A.
        Kenneth Pye (1970-1971), John O. Blackburn (1971-1976), A. Kenneth Pye (1976-1982), and H.
        Keith H. Brodie (1982-1985). With Dr. Brodie's inauguration as President, the office was
        left vacant until William G. Anlyan, M.D., was named Chancellor in 1988. He retired in 1990
        and was not replaced. </p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection includes memoranda, correspondence, published materials, reports, printed
        matter, clippings and other materials generated by the Office of the Chancellor during Pye's
        two terms as Chancellor (1970-1971 and 1976-1982). There are also correspondence, speeches,
        printed matter, and subject files collected by Pye from 1968 to 1976 as Dean of the School
        of Law, Chancellor, and University Counsel.</p>
      <p> The first series consists of subject files created during Pye's first tenure as
        Chancellor, 1970-1971. Subjects include the merger of the Woman's College with Trinity
        College, an evaluation of the university's relationship with the Army Research Office in
        Durham, Duke's position on admission standards for student-athletes in the Atlantic Coast
        Conference, the Summer Transitional Program, international studies, the evaluation of the
        Navy and Air Force ROTC programs, African-American studies, the Pickets and Protest Policy
        and student unrest, and regulations pertaining to drug use and other aspects of student
        life. Administrative officers who communicated with Pye in regard to these matters include
        James Price, Dean of Undergraduate Education, William Griffith, Dean of Student Affairs, and
        President Terry Sanford. </p>
      <p> The second series consists of subject files created during Pye's second tenure as
        Chancellor, 1976-1982. As Chancellor, Pye had overall responsibility for planning and
        budgeting at the university, and the files reflect the retrenchment and long-range planning
        process that occurred at Duke in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Other subjects include
        reports on the enrollment of North Carolina students, the admission of African-Americans,
        A.B. Duke Scholars from the years 1926 to 1981, financial aid and admissions, the Duke
        University Athletic Association (DUAA), the recruitment and admission of student-athletes,
        the Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics of the American Council on Education, Title IX
        of the Education Amendments, affirmative action, planning for the University Center (Bryan
        University Center), East Campus planning and residential life, the Public Safety department,
        black affairs, labor relations and unionization, the Nixon Library controversy, the American
        Dance Festival, the Marine Laboratory, and forestry, nursing, sociology, and education
        programs. </p>
      <p> A subseries of the subject files created during Pye's second tenure as Chancellor,
        1976-1982, is related to the Duke University Medical Center. Major subjects include Highland
        Hospital (Asheville, NC), the School of Nursing, and retrenchment. William G. Anlyan, Vice
        President for Health Affairs, is the primary correspondent within the series.</p>
      <p> A subseries of the subject files created during Pye's second tenure as Chancellor,
        1976-1982, contains files regarding various standing and ad hoc committees and files
        pertaining to planning committees and the University Long-Range Planning Committee. Other
        committees represented include the Athletic Council, Committee on the Social Implications of
        Duke's Investment Policies, search committees for a provost and a Vice-Chancellor for Data
        Processing, and the Undergraduate Faculty Council in the Arts and Sciences (UFCAS) Committee
        on Financial Aid and Admissions. </p>
      <p> A subseries of the subject files created during Pye's second tenure as Chancellor,
        1976-1982, consists of files created by staff assistants in the Chancellor's office, chiefly
        Gail Hagel and Jennifer Hillman. The files consist chiefly of information gathered in
        relation to long-range planning, including questionnaires, communications with members of
        the Long-Range Planning Committee, statistical data, and other materials.</p>
      <p> The third series, A. Kenneth Pye Papers, 1968-1976, includes typescripts of speeches,
        correspondence, reports, and other material created during Pye's tenure as Dean of the
        School of Law, Chancellor, and University Counsel. The papers reflect matters outside of
        Duke University. The correspondence, spanning 1968 to 1974, includes letter from Pye's
        former law students and gives details about their careers and lives. Pye's responses are
        included. The correspondence further reflects Pye's work as an attorney and an educator, as
        it in part pertains to legal questions and issues. North Carolina Senator Sam Ervin and
        Chief Justice Warren Burger are among those who consulted with Pye on legal matters. The
        speeches and addresses, which are dated from 1968 to 1974, were primarily delivered at other
        institutions and relate to legal education and legal issues, including student
        demonstrations. Several subject files include reports and materials on university matters,
        including a public hearing on the ROTC, a 1975 report on teacher education at Duke, and
        reports from the Durham Urban Observatory, a joint research project between Duke, North
        Carolina Central University, and the city of Durham. </p>

              subjects include reports on the enrollment of North Carolina students, the admission
              of African-Americans, A.B. Duke Scholars from the years 1926 to 1981, financial aid
              and admissions, the Duke University Athletic Association (DUAA), the recruitment and
              admission of student-athletes, the Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics of the

            <p>This subseries consists of committee files created during Pye's second tenure as
              Chancellor, 1976-1982. The files are arranged into two sub-series: files regarding
              various standing committees and ad hoc committees are followed by files pertaining to
              planning committees and the University Long-Range Planning Committee. Other committees
              represented include the Athletic Council, Committee on the Social Implications of
              Duke's Investment Policies, search committees for a provost and a Vice-Chancellor for
              Data Processing, and the Undergraduate Faculty Council in the Arts and Sciences
              (UFCAS) Committee on Financial Aid and Admissions. Information assembled by the
              Long-Range Planning Committee and it various taskforces was used in two planning
              documents written by Pye: Planning for the Eighties (1978) and Directions for Progress
              (1980). Directions for Progress proposed reorganization in the School of Forestry and
              Environmental Studies and discontinuing the School of Nursing and the Department of
              Education. Other subjects include financial aid and admissions, instruction in the
              arts, the Department of Education, residential life, cooperative programs, the marine
              laboratory, and the Department of Sociology. Major correspondents include Bruce
              Wardropper, H. Keith H. Brodie, William Bevan, and Jean O'Barr.</p>

          <p>This series includes typescripts of speeches, correspondence, reports, and other
            material created during Pye's tenure as Dean of the School of Law, Chancellor, and
            University Counsel. The papers reflect matters outside of Duke University. The
            correspondence, spanning 1968 to 1974, includes letter from Pye's former law students
            and gives details about their careers and lives. Pye's responses are included. The
            correspondence further reflects Pye's work as an attorney and an educator, as it in part
            pertains to legal questions and issues. North Carolina Senator Sam Ervin and Chief
            Justice Warren Burger are among those who consulted with Pye on legal matters. The
            speeches and addresses, which are dated from 1968 to 1974, were primarily delivered at
            other institutions and relate to legal education and legal issues, including student
            demonstrations. Several subject files include reports and materials on university
            matters, including a public hearing on the ROTC, a 1975 report on teacher education at
            Duke, and reports from the Durham Urban Observatory, a joint research project between
            Duke, North Carolina Central University, and the city of Durham.</p>
