      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>SHARE (Student Housing for Academic and Residential Experimentation) was founded in 1970 as
        an academically elite experimental living group of 54 men and women. The integrated
        residence, then known as the Experimental College, was part of Duke's "New Curriculum". The
        "New Curriculum" recommendations of 1969 had suggested various changes in living
        arrangements for students on campus, including the elimination of freshmen dormitories and
        the establishment of a co-educational dormitory.</p>
      <p>SHARE generally included students who were creative and possessed special talents or
        interests. SHARE applicants also had to demonstrate a clear sense of academic direction, and
        show interest in helping develop programs of the Experimental College within the first year.
        Students enrolled in Program II, an interdisciplinary study program, were given preference
        to live in the SHARE house.</p>
      <p>The first director, overseeing the academic progress of residents, was English professor
        John Clum. Clum worked closely with the administration of Duke University to blend SHARE's
        social and academic components into a sustainable living environment. SHARE was first
        located in the Faculty Apartments (now Wilson House) on Duke University's East Campus. The
        apartment-type layout of the building allowed for men and women to live closely together
        while preserving privacy. SHARE participants lived in Wilson House until 1982, then in
        Alspaugh House from 1983 to 1984. In 1984, SHARE moved again to Epworth Inn, where it would
        remain until 1997. In 1997, SHARE was moved to Wilson House. </p>
      <p>SHARE programming consisted of a variety of seminars, credit courses, meetings, film
        festivals, and lectures. Events included a "Use Your Appendages" Party, Anime Fest, Epworth
        Prom (Oil My Lizard), The Epworth Retreat, and "Twilight", a rave. Two of the most notable
        activities were SHARE hours and Pedagogo. SHARE hours gave members of the dorm an
        opportunity to tell others about their interest and experiences. Pedagogo was a series of
        events where members of the Duke University faculty were invited to Epworth to speak
        informally about issues in research and academics. </p>
      <p>In 1995, SHARE became the first living group on campus to include members from all four
        undergraduate years. SHARE persisted as an alternative to conventional Duke residential
        life. When cited for low membership in 1997, SHARE was relocated from Epworth House to the
        third floor in Wilson House. As of 2003, SHARE is active at Duke University.</p>
