      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>The Chamber Arts Society (CAS) was formed in 1945 to support classical music performances
        by small chamber ensembles at Duke University. Ernest Nelson, a professor of Renaissance
        History, led the formation of the Society with several other faculty members and was the
        first Director, 1945-1963. Leland Phelps, a professor in the German Department, was Director
        from 1963 to 1971, succeeded by Ruth Blum from 1979 to 2000. In 2000, Professor of
        mathematics Robert Bryant became Director and was then succeeded in 2007 by Professor of
        English George Gopen. Initially independent of the University, in 1985 the financial
        administration of the CAS was taken over by Susan Coon of the Duke Office of Cultural
        Affairs, later the Duke Institute of the Arts and then the Duke Performances Series. The CAS
        also has an Advisory Board of eight members of the University community who work with the
        Director of CAS and Duke Performances.</p>
      <p>For the first 60 years of operation, the CAS held about five concerts per season, inviting
        well-respected artists from all over the world. Since George Gopen assumed the directorship,
        the CAS has held about eight concerts per season. Repeat performers have included the Beaux
        Arts Trio, the Julliard String Quartet, the St Lawrence Quartet, the Takacs Quartet, the
        Emerson String Quartet, and many others.</p>
