         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>George "Jelly" Leftwich, a native of Wilmington, NC, was born in 1905. He joined Duke
            University in 1926 as conductor of the Duke University Club Orchestra, where he remained
            until 1933. Leftwich is remembered best for having written the words and music to Duke's
            fight song, "The Blue and White." He ultimately turned over the song's rights to the
            university.</p>
         <p>During his time as conductor, Leftwich elevated both the level of musicianship and
            number of participants in the music department. His orchestra regularly performed and
            traveled, while billed as "the South's Finest College Band." Leftwich was never known to
            have mastered an instrument himself, but was well regarded in his capacity as
            conductor.</p>
         <p>Leftwich's time prior to Duke is unclear. While he is credited in newspapers with having
            attended the University of North Carolina before transferring to Duke in his sophomore
            year, there is no official record of him as a student at the university. Certain
            contents of his scrapbooks indicate that he led the Wilmington, NC Seashore Hotel
            Orchestra in the summer season and was a member of the Carolinians Orchestra in the time
            leading up to his acceptance of an offer from Duke.</p>
         <p>After his time at Duke, Leftwich changed his name to Lee Dixon and pursued a career as a
            musician. However, he experienced little success and ultimately left the music business
            during World War II. Upon his music retirement, Leftwich went into the hotel industry
            and eventually became the manager of the "Downtown Club" in Richmond, Virginia.</p>
         <p>Leftwich married his former vocalist Kay Keeyer, and they had two sons. He died in 1977
            in Richmond, Virginia, and was buried in his hometown of Wilmington, NC.</p>
