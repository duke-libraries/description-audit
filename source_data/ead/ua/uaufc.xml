            Faculty Council (UFC) was responsible for the governance of undergraduate education at
            Duke University. The Undergraduate Faculty Council of Arts and Sciences succeeded the
            UFC in October 1971, when undergraduate education in engineering and nursing formed
            separate governing bodies. Collection includes minutes, memoranda, correspondence,
            questionnaires, reports of standing and ad hoc committees, and other papers pertaining
            to faculty oversight of undergraduate education. The bulk of the material consists of
            the records of the Subcommittee on Curriculum, a part of the Committee on Undergraduate
            Instruction. Other committees include Honors, Program II, the Faculty Advisory System,
            Residential Life, Study Abroad, Undergraduate Admissions, Financial Aid, and Academic
            Standards. One of the major accomplishments of the UFC was a report called "Varieties of
            Learning Experience," or the Krueger Report (1968), which led to major changes in the
            undergraduate course of study known as the "new curriculum." English.</abstract>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>Undergraduate Faculty Council began in 1952, as a result of a re-organization of the
            Duke University Faculty. The Undergraduate Faculty Council (UFC) was responsible for the
            governance of undergraduate education, a task that the Faculty Council previously had
            undertaken. The UFC included representatives from the Engineering and Nursing schools.
            The Dean of Trinity College served as chair. The UFC first met on November 13, 1952. The
            Undergraduate Faculty Council of Arts and Sciences succeeded the UFC in October 1971,
            when undergraduate education in engineering and nursing formed separate governing
            bodies. </p>
         <p> Standing Committees of the Undergraduate Faculty Council included Undergraduate
            Instruction (which absorbed the Curriculum Committee and the Committee on Courses of
            Instruction between 1964-1965), Honors, Program II, the Faculty Advisory System,
            Residential Life, Study Abroad, Undergraduate Admissions, and Financial Aid. Ad hoc
            committees included Academic Standards, Committee on Committees, and the Committee on
            the Organization and Functions of the UFC. The creation of a report called "Varieties of
            Learning Experience," or the Krueger Report (1968), represents one of the major
            accomplishments of the Undergraduate Faculty Council. The Krueger Report led to major
            changes in the undergraduate course of study known as the "new curriculum." </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Collection includes minutes, memoranda, correspondence, and questionnaires, reports of
            standing and ad hoc committees, and other papers pertaining to faculty oversight of
            undergraduate education. The bulk of the material consists of the records of the
            Subcommittee on Curriculum, a part of the Committee on Undergraduate Instruction. The
            Subcommittee's records feature the Krueger report, "Varieties of Learning Experience
            (1968), which led to the substantial changes in the undergraduate courses of study known
            as the "new curriculum." These files include results of a survey of faculty members and
            freshmen participating in small group learning experiences. The other major curriculum
            study is the Parker report (1960). </p>
         <p>The Program II files contain material from the period after 1971, when the Undergraduate
            Faculty Council of Arts and Sciences was formed. Records of the Supervisory Committee
            for the Faculty Advisory System include scattered minutes of the committee, memoranda,
            correspondence, and reports, as well as handbooks for faculty advisers from 1952 to
            1964. A number of ad hoc and superseded committees' files are also in the
            collection.</p>
