      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Duke University Office of Student Activities and Facilities (OSAF) serves as a liaison
        between the university administration and student groups, clubs, and organizations. OSAF
        also has an advising component, serving recognized student organizations at Duke University.
        In 2012, OSAF merged with Event Management and changed its name to University Center
        Activities &amp; Events (UCAE).</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Office of Student Activities and Facilities Records, 1936-ongoing, contain
        correspondence, charters, directories, annual reports, financial statements, and other
        detailed information on many Duke University student organizations, including Duke Student
        Government (DSG), Associated Students of Duke University (ASDU), the Undergraduate
        Publications board, the Duke University Union, and the Office of University Life. In
        addition to documenting the histories of specific on-campus groups, the OSAF Records provide
        a wealth of material on Duke University students in general, including but not limited to
        their social life, political activity, and changing social customs throughout the 20th
        century.</p>
      <p>Arrangement: unless stated otherwise, all accessions are arranged as received, generally in
        alphabetical order.</p>

      <head>Related Material</head>
      <p>Because the Office of Student Activities and Facilities Records contain a sampling of
        documents from many Duke University student groups that span several decades, the collection
        complements many others already held in the University Archives. The following is a short
        but not exhaustive list of related collections that can be accessed at the David M.
        Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library. Additional materials can be found by
        searching the online catalog for the names of individual groups, university offices,
        residential houses, and fraternities and sororities.</p>

            <p>Although apparently compiled in 1937, the lists in this folder group cite officers of
              various clubs and organizations as early as the late 1880s. In addition to documenting
              the histories of various campus groups, the folders contain extensive demographic data
              about the student body spanning several decades, since student officers' home
              addresses are given in most cases. The folder "Class Officers" contains "A Tentative
              List of Student Organizations and Enterprises, Trinity College and Duke University,
              1846-1937," a compilation of some 400 student organizations from the first century of
              the university's history.</p>

            <p>Documentation of the history of the "Hal Kammerer Memorial Award for Original Student
              Film or Video Production, Duke University." The files contain the annual nominees and
              winners of the award from 1985-2004, including the filmmakers' descriptions of their
              films. The first folder in the group documents the establishment and early history of
              the award, circa 1983-1984, "to recognize outstanding achievement in the art and
              science of film or video production." [Note: entitled both "award" and "prize" in

          <p>Records include materials related to Duke Student Government, the Duke University
            Union, ongoing campus series such as Major Attractions and Major Speakers, the Office of
            University Life, and extensive event registration forms and contracts related to the
            Events Advising Committee (EAC).</p>
          <p>Arrangement: Materials were received predominantly unarranged, with some folders
            batched by campus group, some chronologically, and some in no discernible order.
            Arrangement is now chronological by fiscal year. Fiscal years 1959-1994, which contain
            only a small amount of material, are arranged in one group by folder title. Following
            that, FY 1994-95 through FY 2005-06 are arranged year-by-year, and will be made
            available to researchers as each successive 25-year restriction is lifted.</p>
