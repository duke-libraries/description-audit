         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Richard Lyness Watson, Jr. was born December 25, 1914 in Mount Hermon, Mass. He attended
            Mount Hermon Preparatory School and graduated 1931. He studied economics and history at
            Yale University, receiving his B.A. in 1935, and his Ph.D. in 1939. Immediately after
            attaining his doctorate he moved to Durham and began teaching at Duke University. He was
            drafted into the Army in 1941 and commissioned in May 1943. He first served at the Coast
            Artillery School until appointed to the Army Air Force Historical Office. While at this
            post he served as chief of the Southwest Pacific Branch and was responsible for
            selecting documents on and writing histories pertaining to the Pacific theatre of
            operations during the War. His work was ultimately included in the seven volume series,
               <title type="simple" render="italic">The Army Air Forces in World War II</title>,
            edited by Wesley Frank Craven and James Lea Cate. </p>
         <p> During his forty-five year tenure at Duke, Watson served as one of the university's
            leading "citizens." He not only served in positions of leadership at the departmental
            level, but at the university level as well. Duke recognized his citizenship in 1988 when
            they awarded him the Duke University Medal for Distinguished Meritorious Service. While
            trained to specialize in early 19th century American history, Watson filled a needed
            role in the Department of History by shifting his research and teaching focus to early
            twentieth-century American history. His particular interests lay in the Progressive,
            Depression, and New Deal Eras. He chaired the department from 1960-1967 and stood in as
            Acting Chair in 1970-1971 and 1980. He took a lead in the burgeoning development of
            Black Studies, teaching several summer workshops for college professors on the materials
            of black history.</p>
         <p>Watson led, at numerous points in his career, the faculty's most important
            representative bodies. He was vice chair of the University Council from 1961-1962;
            Chairman of the Academic Council from 1964-1966, as well as 1975-1977; and vice chair of
            the Academic Council from 1973-1974. He was the first person to hold the position of
            Faculty Secretary of the Academic Council, a position created in 1984. In addition, he
            was a member of the board of the Duke University Press from 1973-1982, and was associate
            editor of the <title type="simple" render="italic">South Atlantic Quarterly</title> from
            1974-1987. Watson also played a central role in the faculty movement to bar the Nixon
            presidential library from locating at Duke.</p>
         <p>Watson answered the university administration's call to service. This is evidenced in
            the numerous committees, advisory councils, and task forces to which he was appointed.
            He played a significant role in helping define and implement university policies during
            student unrest of the late 1960s. As chair of the Committee on Judicial Procedures he
            helped put into place judicial procedures and policies to deal with the pickets and
            protests regulations. He also served on the Faculty Committee on Student Concerns which
            helped develop policies in response to the takeover of the Allen Building in 1969 and
            his work on the Student-Faculty-Administration Committee addressed drug policies,
            military recruitment on campus, and the pickets policy. </p>
         <p>Watson served as President of the Southern Historical Association (1976-77) and of the
            Historical Society of North Carolina (1972-73); he was also chair of the Organization of
            American Historians' Frederick Jackson Turner Prize Committee from 1964-68. In addition,
            he sat on the board of editors of both the <title type="simple" render="italic"
               >Mississippi Valley Historical Review</title> (1958-60) and the <title type="simple"
               render="italic">Journal of Southern History</title> (1968-70). He was a member of the
            Board of Trustees of St. Augustine's College from 1965-1971. </p>
         <p>His activity in the Durham community was recognized by the Duke University Campus
            Ministry, who in 1992 awarded him its Humanitarian Service Award. Watson aided in the
            establishment of the St. Philip's Community Kitchen and the Durham Urban Ministry
            Center. He was also a familiar face in community theater, as a long-time member of
            Durham Savoyards, a group that presents annual performances of Gilbert and Sullivan. </p>
         <p>In the midst of his teaching and academic service, Watson continued to conduct and
            publish scholarly research. He won the R.D.W. Connor Award for the best article to
            appear in the <title type="simple" render="italic">North Carolina Historical
               Review</title> in both 1960 and 1965. He contributed greatly to the teaching of
            history in the secondary schools by his editorship, along with William Cartwright, of
               <title type="simple" render="italic">Interpreting and Teaching American
               History</title> (196?) and its revised edition, <title type="simple" render="italic"
               >Reinterpretation of American History and Culture</title>. Other books he authored or
            edited include, <title type="simple" render="italic">Bishop Cannon's Own Story</title>,
            the <title type="simple" render="italic">United States in the Contemporary World,
               1945-62</title>, and <title type="simple" render="italic">The Development of National
               Power: The United States 1900-1919</title>. </p>
         <p>Upon retirement in 1984, Watson continued his relationship with Duke. He was active in
            the university's FOCUS program, as well as hosting Japanese students from Hosei
            University each year.</p>
         <p>Richard L. Watson, Jr. died on September 22, 2000. </p>

               <p>The first series, Army Air Force Historical Office, contains material Watson
                  collected while serving as the Chief of the Southwest Pacific Branch of the Army

                  the seven volume series, The Army Air Forces in World War II, edited by Wesley
                  Frank Craven and James Lea Cate. Watson's contributions to the series pertain

                  correspondence about the work of the Historical Office, newspaper clippings
                  chronicling daily events, and notes taken from primary wartime documents on

               <p>The materials in the second series, History Department, contain information
                  relating to Watson's forty-five year tenure in the department both as a professor
                  and administrator. Insights into his teaching style can be gleaned from numerous
                  teacher-course evaluations as well as syllabi and book lists. The series contains
                  thirty-five years of correspondence primarily relating to departmental and
                  teaching matters. Also included are departmental meeting minutes, enrollment
                  statistics, and materials relating to graduate students. This series includes
                  numerous planning and curriculum reports, the bulk dating from the 1960s to early
                  1970s. There is also a run of the departmental publication <title type="simple"
                     render="italic">Research Notes</title> (Nos. 1-14), which describes the
                  scholarly research of faculty members. The development of the departmental honors
                  program is detailed as well as the early history of teaching African-American
                  history at Duke. This series also contains historical information on the
                  activities of the Trinity College Historical Society, a social and professional
                  society for faculty and graduate students of the History Department.</p>

               <p> The third series, University, documents Watson's involvement and service on
                  numerous faculty and university committees, councils, and task forces. Watson
                  served as vice chair of the University Council from 1961-62; Chairman of the
                  Academic Council from 1964-66, as well as 1975-77; and vice chair of the Academic
                  Council from 1973-74. Materials relating to the University Council document
                  discussion about tuition benefits for faculty children, by-laws, faculty
                  qualification and improvements, and the role of University Council. His long
                  service on the Undergraduate Faculty Council (UFC) and Undergraduate Faculty
                  Council of Arts and Sciences (UFCAS) is reflected in this series. He chaired the
                  UFC Faculty Committee on Admissions and the minutes and report are contained in
                  these files. He also was appointed to the review committee on the structure of
                  UFCAS. In addition, in the early 1970s Watson was on the executive committee of
                  the Undergraduate Faculty Committee of Arts and Sciences. These files include a
                  proposal on Afro-American studies. </p>
               <p> Watson was appointed to numerous university committees formed in response to the
                  period of student protest and unrest of the late 1960s. This series contains
                  minutes, reports, correspondence, and background material from said committees.
                  The Committee on Judicial Procedures, also called the "Watson Committee", was
                  created to define and implement judicial procedures and address the pickets and
                  protests regulations. The files contain committee reports, meeting minutes,
                  background materials and correspondence. They also include information on the
                  existing judicial structures and procedures of the Men's Student Government
                  Association, the Women's Student Government Association, and the Nursing and
                  Medical Schools. There is also information on honor codes as embedded in the
                  judicial structures. The materials from the Faculty Committee on Student Concerns
                  relate to the Allen Building takeover, Afro-American studies program, and the
                  Afro-American society. The Student-Faculty-Administration Committee files contain
                  information relating to university drug policy, military recruitment on campus,
                  and pickets and protest policies. </p>
               <p> In 1981, Duke President Terry Sanford proposed Duke as a possible site for the
                  Richard M. Nixon presidential library. Watson played a central role in faculty
                  debate over the appropriateness of placing the library at Duke. This series
                  contains news clippings, correspondence, academic council material, and his own
                  diary and notes on the controversy. </p>
               <p> Materials in this series relating to the Committee on Social Implications of
                  Duke's Investment Policy all appear to be originals from committee co-chair
                  William A. Reppy and chairman James D. Cox's files. The committee consisted of
                  twelve members appointed by the President and included four administrators, four
                  faculty members, and four students. The committee was allowed to make specific
                  recommendations or general guidelines to the Board of Trustees. It primarily dealt
                  with issues relating to investments with companies doing business with South
                  Africa. This collection of materials includes news articles, church shareholder
                  resolutions, correspondence, and minutes. </p>
               <p> Other committees and subjects addressed in this series include the Task Force on
                  Yearly Operations, the Institute of Policy Studies and Public Affairs, the library
                  council and the George Washington Flowers Collection, the Forest History Society,
                  Phi Beta Kappa, the <title type="simple" render="italic">South Atlantic
                     Quarterly</title>, and the YMCA. </p>

               <p>The fourth series, Professional Organizations, documents Watson's long
                  contribution of service to national, state, and local professional historical
                  organizations and his work for the promotion of history. His work with the
                  American Historical Association includes serving on the Ad hoc committee on Ph.D.
                  programs in history, as well as being a session chair and member of the committee
                  to collect the basic data of American political history. For six years he served
                  the Organization of American Historians, and its predecessor organization, the
                  Mississippi Valley Historical Association, as a member of their prize committees.
                  Documents in this series shed light on the changes in prize policy and process. In
                  addition to serving as its president from 1976-1977, Watson served on numerous
                  annual program committees and as session chairs for the Southern Historical
                  Association. This series contains material on program and nominating committees,
                  sessions, and his work on the board of editors of the <title type="simple"
                     render="italic">Journal of Southern History</title>. </p>
               <p>Watson also worked to advance the promotion of history. This series documents his
                  work with the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, the NDEA
                  Institute for Advanced Study in American History, the National Coordinating
                  Committee for the Promotion of History, and the United Negro College Fund
                  Distinguished Scholars Program. </p>
               <p> The series also contains materials related to Watson's work with historical
                  organizations at the state and local level. It documents his twenty-year
                  involvement with the Historical Society of North Carolina, as well as his work
                  with the North Carolina Literary and Historical Association, and the State
                  Archives of North Carolina. At the local level, this series contains materials
                  about the Durham County history project to publish a history of Durham County,
                  N.C.</p>

               <p>Forty years of Watson's research and writings are reflected in this fifth series,
                  Research and Writings. The bulk of the series is related to the two major books
                  that Watson edited along with William Cartwright, <title type="simple"
                     render="italic">Interpreting and Teaching American History</title>, and <title
                     type="simple" render="italic">Reinterpretation of American History and
                     Culture</title>. These books were aimed at giving a historiographical overview
                  of American history to high school teachers. Leading scholars of the time
                  contributed essays. The files, which include chapter files and general
                  correspondence, reflect the changes in historiographical interpretations of
                  American history from the early 1960s to the early 1970s. Book reviews, articles,
                  grants and grant applications make up the rest of the series.</p>
