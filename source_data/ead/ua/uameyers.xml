        professors in Duke University's Department of Religion. Throughout their careers, they have
        conducted archeological digs in relation to their interest in biblical and Judaic studies.
        The collection contains extensive materials related to several major excavations the pair
        conducted in Israel from the 1970s to the 1990s. The materials in the collection include
        binders and notebooks of field notes, charts, maps, and records; notecards; photographs
        (including slides, prints, and negatives), almost all black-and-white; a few audiovisual
        items; clippings; some administrative and correspondence files; coins; and drawings of sites
        and artifacts. There are many electronic files, some of which represent items not present in
        the collection. Topics include 20th century archaeology and practices; the Sepphoris,
        Meiron, Khirbet Shema, Nabratein, and Gush Halav excavation sites in Israel, including maps
        and photographs of the sites; Jewish and Arabic artifacts such as coins and pottery; other
        ancient artifacts; and religious and biblical studies as they relate to
        archaeology.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The collection contains extensive materials related to several major excavations conducted
        by the Meyers and their teams in Israel from the 1970s to the 1990s, as well as materials
        related to later publications about their work. Formats include binders and notebooks of
        field notes, charts, and records; maps; notecards; photographs (including many slides,
        prints, and negatives); coins; news clippings; a few video and audio recordings; some
        administrative and correspondence files; and many drawings of sites and artifacts. There are
        also electronic records, most of which are black-and-white scans of photographs, negatives,
        and field notebooks, and drawings, many of these, but not all, are scans of items located in
        the collection.</p>
      <p>Topics represented by the materials include 20th century archaeology and practices; the
        Sepphoris, Meiron, Khirbet Shema, Nabratein, and Gush Halav excavation sites in Israel,
        including maps and many photographs of the sites; Jewish and Arabic artifacts such as coins
        and pottery; other ancient artifacts; and religious and biblical studies as they relate to
        archaeology.</p>
      <p>Materials have been kept in the binders and folders in which they were received. The
        collection is organized by accession number, but materials in separate accession number
        groups are intrinsically connected.</p>
      <p>The addition (A2003-30) includes binders from an archeological dig in Gush Halav, and
        Arabic and Jewish coins from the Meiron and Khirbet Shema digs. </p>
      <p>Accessions from 2010 and 2017 include materials from archeological digs in Nabratein,
        Meiron, Gush Halav, and Khirbet Shema.</p>
      <p>The accessions from 2019 include materials from digs in Khirbet Shema, Gush Halav,
        Nabratein, Meiron, and Sepphoris, among other materials. Also received in 2019 are over 1200
        digital files from the Sepphoris site, which have been migrated to a library server.</p>

          <p>These materials contain information about the Meyerses' digs in Meiron and Khirbet
            Shema in Israel during the early and mid-1970s. These notes and records were later used

          <p>Series comprises eletronic files of scanned photographic images, fieldbooks, and
            illustrations, all relating to the archaeological work on the Sepphoris site in Israel
            by teams from Duke University, led by Carol and Eric Meyers, and Hebrew University. The
            majority of the scans represent physical objects found in the Meyers collection. </p>
          <p>Series dates for electronic files indicate the creation date for the digital scans
            rather than the physical objects or images. Series descriptions were taken almost
            verbatim from donor-supplied notes received with the electronic files.</p>
          <p>The photographic images, most of which are scans of physical prints and negatives in
            the Meyers collection, were taken by Sepphoris site team members from about 1984 to
            1995, almost all in black-and-white. Most are of site excavations and objects found in
            situ; another much smaller group consists of Sepphoris artifacts photographed in the
            U.S. lab in 2011. The fieldbooks date from 1984 to 1997 and contain extensive notes as
            well as some photographs; this group also includes the 2000 Duke team final site reports
            in .pdf format. Many of the original field notebooks are in the collection at Hebrew
            University, thus the scans may be the only representation in the Meyers papers. The
            Sepphoris illustration archive contains scans of drawings and other work, some of which
            were used for the 2013 Duke publication on Sepphoris pottery.</p>

              <p>These scans were done in Jerusalem, as the inkings themselves are located there. A
                note to provide some context and background: The Hebrew University and Duke teams
                split around 1990, and at that point divided up the archaeological site they had
                been excavating into two fields: a Hebrew U field and a Duke field. The "Hebrew U
                Archive Pottery Scans" contains pottery drawings from both fields. Those that are
                under the proprietary domain of Hebrew U consist of any drawing with a registration
                number beginning with 84.3, 85.2, 86.1, 86.2, 86.3. (Those numbers are the
                excavation areas within the Hebrew U field.) These drawings are not included on the
                spreadsheet "Artifact Drawings and Photos Archive," because they were not used in
                the Duke publication project.</p>

            <p>These are scans of the fieldbooks for the Sepphoris site excavations. These logs and
              notes were created by the area supervisors working for the dig team from approximately
              1984 to 1997; includes the final site reports from 2000. Some of the fieldbooks exist
              at Duke only in digital form, as their hard copies are currently at the Hebrew
              University in Jerusalem. Other files represent physical copies in the collection. Some
              of these fieldbooks also contain Polaroid photographs that were affixed to the page of
              the book.</p>

            <p>These scans derive from photographs taken in 2011 by Sean Burrus (former Duke
              graduate student) for his chapter on the small objects discovered at Sepphoris III.
              There are four sub-folders by material (bone, ceramic, metal, and stone) and the file
              names contain the artifact registration number. The catalog numbers for the objects,
              which appear in Sepphoris III, are different than the registration number.</p>
