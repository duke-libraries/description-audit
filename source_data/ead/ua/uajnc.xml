         <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
         <p>The son of famed Methodist minister Rev. John Nelson Cole, John Nelson Cole, Jr. was
            born in 1895 and grew up in Rockingham, NC. He entered Trinity College in 1905 and was a
            member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity as well as the Glee Club. He was also friends
            with Angier B. Duke.</p>
         <p> After graduating in 1909 with a degree in journalism, Cole went on to teach English at
            the Woodberry School in Orange, VA for a short time. From 1910 to 1912, he attended
            Columbia University's journalism program. He subsequently worked for the Baltimore
            Hotel, the N.Y. Edison Company, and as a reporter for the New York Evening Post. Later,
            he worked as advertising writer and salesman for the U.S. Printing and Lithograph
            Company. Eventually, he became founder and president of the Planographic Equipment
            Company, which manufactured printing presses and produced pictorial sections for large
            newspapers. </p>

            telegrams, photographs, event programs, tickets, as well as some of Cole's own poems,

         <head>Collection Arrangement</head>
         <p>Cole included these items in string-bound patent scrapbook of over 100 pages. The
            original scrapbook has been unbound and photocopied for preservation, due to the fragile
            and acidic paper. Scrapbook and photocopy were then re-boxed into two boxes. No further
            processing.</p>

               <p>This scrapbook contains clippings, correspondence, photographs, and memorabilia
                  from Cole's last year at Trinity College, and from his subsequent career.
                  Materials from his time at Trinity College include photographs and memorabilia
                  from athletics, Glee Club, and Alpha Tau Omega events. Also included are wedding
                  invitations and clippings, including some related to the wedding of Mary Duke
                  Biddle. Cole wrote and included many journal-style entries about his daily life,
                  particularly during the years 1909-1912. The scrapbook also contains ephemera from
                  his travel to Paris and his career in New York, as well newspaper obituaries upon
                  the death of his father. Loosely arranged in chronological order.</p>
